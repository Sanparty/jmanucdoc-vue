But sometimes a kitchen makeover can be achieved with some simple cosmetic changes, rather than a complete redesign of the actual floor plan.</p>
    <p>   
    Beyond a basic color scheme change, the next makeover level involves replacing cabinet hardware. Remove a set of hinges, knobs and/or pulls to identify the type of screw/bolt settings that will be needed. Then, choose from the many options available at home building centers or specialty knob stores. Similarly, consider a new faucet and sink, upgraded countertop or a fresh tile backsplash. Each will contribute to a dramatic change. You may want to consider replacing or refinishing the drawer and cupboard facings as well, although that would likely require professional help.
    </p>
    <p>
    Improved lighting is another important way to change a kitchen’s look and functionality. However, general overhead lighting, strategic task lighting and ambient mood lighting could involve rewiring. Finally, replacing the flooring will result in a significant change to any kitchen. Choices range from recycled cork to indestructible granite. Remember to consider not only appearance but also practicality.

    <p>Will you need to deal with a Property Surveyor when you sell your home?</p>
    <p>You might.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the mortgage lender will ask for a land survey, especially if your property is older and hasn’t changed hands in many years. You might also be asked for one by the buyer if there is any confusion about the size and boundaries of your property – or if significant changes have been made to it in recent years.</p>
    <p>This is nothing to be concerned about.</p>
    <p>A qualified Property Surveyor will do the appropriate inspections and measurements on your property and issue you the survey.</p>
    <p>Property Surveyors are highly trained and licensed. The profession is represented by their respective governing bodies.</p>
    <p>Before spending the money on a new land survey, make sure you don’t already have one. Hopefully, you’ve stored the paperwork that relates to the purchase of your home. Look through it. A valid land survey might be right there.</p>

  content: `<p>Sometimes we don’t get to choose whether or not to sell our home and buy another one. Circumstances, such as a job relocation, may make that decision for us.</p>
    <p>However, most often, the decision to move is discretionary. Sometimes people move simply because they think it’s a good idea. They feel that “now” is the right time to find their next dream home.</p>
    <p>You may feel you need to find a new home, because you’ve outgrown your current property. Perhaps you have a growing family and require more space. Maybe you’re doing more entertaining and need a larger backyard with a more spacious deck. It could be that the commute to work is arduous and you need to move to a place that’s closer.</p>
    <p>Those “needs” may motivate you to move, but sometimes a “want” can play an important role too.</p>
    <p>For example, you may want to live in a quieter area or in a newly built home that requires less maintenance. Maybe you simply want a change.</p>
    <p>If you’re thinking of making a move, take a moment to write down a list of your needs and wants. Seeing them on paper will help make the decision easier.</p>

You just need to make sure that in all your excitement you don’t overlook any expensive maintenance issues that could be just around the corner.</p>
    <p>Nothing lasts forever. The major components of every home - from the furnace to the roof shingles - need to be replaced eventually. But, knowing when those maintenance issues are likely to arise can help you make a smarter decision about the home you’re considering.</p>
    <p>How do you do that?</p>
    <p>When viewing the property, ask for the age of the major components of the home, such as the roof shingles, furnace, air conditioner, water heater, and appliances. You might think the roof shingles look merely weathered in spots and have years of service left – when in fact, they’re due to be replaced next year.</p>
    <p>Also pay close attention to the backyard deck, fencing, flooring, and windows. Do any of those components look aged, worn, and in need of repair or replacement sometime soon?</p>
    <p>Finally, don’t forget to check the kitchen and bathrooms. Sinks, faucets, bathtubs, showers, and cabinetry have a life-span of about 10-15 years.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are things you can’t see on your own, such as wiring, plumbing, venting, and other components of a property that may require maintenance. That’s why you should always make any offer to purchase a home conditional on passing an inspection by a qualified home inspector.</p>

  content: `<p>It has become standard for retailers to offer low cost supplementary “insurance protection plans” on appliances and electronics. These plans may seem like a good idea, but before you buy one, be sure the plan actually offers real added value. Often, these plans overlap with other protection programs you already have.</p>
    <p>For example, reputable retailers usually sell products with solid manufacturer warranties, because they don’t want the bad reputation or the hassles that come from unhappy customers. In fact, in today’s competitive world, many retailers already have a “satisfaction guaranteed” policy built into everything they sell. In addition, if you are paying by credit card, you may have purchaser protection that is activated by simply using the card.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are many consumer protection plans that do offer reasonable value. For example, some extended warranties offer a safety net after the manufacturer’s warranty runs out (similar to extended warranty automobile plans}. In those cases, be sure the product is one you’ll want to keep and use for the duration of the warranty period. For example, it makes no sense to pay an extra thirty dollars on a one hundred dollar item, if you expect you will be able to buy a newer version in a few years for even less. Some “total care” service plans for complicated equipment, such as a car, computer or HVAC unit, are quite popular, as are “price freezing” plans on home utilities, such as electricity, gas and water. At the end of the day, it all comes down to your confidence in a product or service, and your willingness to put up with (or pay to avoid) the inconvenience of complaining, should it fail to meet your expectations.</p>`,

    <li>Water the lawn, not the sidewalk or driveway.</li>
    <li>Lawns need about an inch of water per week. To determine how much watering time that requires, place an empty tuna tin within your sprinkler’s range, and note how long it takes to fill.</li>
    <li>When watering, account for recent rain.</li>
    <li>Use an automatic sprinkler system that allows you to adjust the area, frequency and/or duration. Set the timer to operate just prior to sunrise.</li>
    <li>Attach rain barrels to downspouts, in order to catch and hold roof runoff and then re-distribute it to your lawn, garden or container plants. Keep it covered for safety reasons, and to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. (Note: rainwater is actually better for plants because it doesn’t contain chlorine and has an ambient temperature).</li>

  content: `<p>If you take care to price your home correctly - that is, at a price that is in line with what similar properties in the area have sold for recently - then you have a good chance of selling it at or near your asking price.</p>
    <p>That doesn’t mean you won’t get a low-ball offer. You might. So, what do you do when that happens?</p>
    <p>First, understand that the buyer may not necessarily be trying to steal away your home at a bargain-basement price. They might simply be mistaken about its true market value. Of course, they might also be coming in at a low price in the hopes they’ll get lucky.</p>
    <p>You will never actually know the buyer’s motives. So, it would be a mistake to get angry or dismiss the offer out-of-hand. That low-ball offer might end up being the beginning of a negotiation that results in the sale of your home at a good price.</p>
    <p>Your first step is to work with a Real Estate Professional to determine:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Whether the buyer is serious.</li>
    <li>Whether the buyer is qualified. (For example, do they have a pre-approved mortgage?)</li>
    <li>How amenable the buyer is to a counter-offer that reflects the true market value of your home.</li>
    <li>What that counter-offer should be.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This isn’t an easy process. It takes the knowledge and experience of a professional real estate agent to get it right.</p>`,

  content: `<p>One of the most prominent features of any home is the windows. If they are well maintained, they will have a positive impact on the impression potential buyers have of your property. Of course, the opposite occurs when your windows look old and worn.</p>
    <p>So, does that mean you should replace your windows?</p>
    <p>That depends on a number of factors. Window replacement can be an expensive renovation. Here are a few things to consider before making your decision.</p>
    <ul type="1">
    <li>Do you see water infiltration or mildew on the interior sides of any of the window sills? This means that moisture is creeping in from the outside, and you need to get those windows repaired or replaced as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>If your windows are double-paned - (two panes of glass) - check for any signs of moisture in between the glass panes. Moisture indicates that the thermal seal is broken and, at a minimum, the glass will need to be replaced.</li>
    <li>Take a look at your windows from the outside. Is the trim rotted or cracked anywhere? Are there dark spots or any signs of rotting on the wood frames? Repairs or replacement may be required.</li>
    <li>Check the operation of your windows. Do they open and close easily? Some windows, such as those in bedrooms, are often designed to be big enough to use as an exit in case of a fire. It’s important to make sure those work properly.</li>
    <li>Finally, are you happy with how your windows look? Do you feel that your property will look significantly better with new windows?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although they are expensive, replacing windows can have a lot of advantages. Depending on the efficiency of your current windows, replacing them could cut your energy costs by 10-20%. In addition, new windows block out more exterior noise, making your home quieter.</p>`,

    <p>Let’s take a look at some of the options available:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Paint it.</strong></p>
    <p>There’s no doubt about it. A fresh coat of paint will significantly improve the appearance of just about any area of your home. In fact, compared to other home improvements, painting will give you the highest return on investment when you sell your property. Think beyond walls. Painting a door, window frame, garage floor or deck can make those features look like new.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Declutter it.</strong></p>
    <p>Eliminating clutter will make your home look more attractive, roomy and comfortable to buyers. Do an inventory of each room. Ask yourself: “What can I throw out? Give away? Sell? Put into storage?”</p>
    <p><strong>3. Put up mirrors.</strong></p>
    <p>Mirrors are a relatively inexpensive design feature. Yet, according to an article in Style At Home magazine, they can make small rooms appear bigger and dark rooms seem brighter. You don’t necessarily need to buy wall-hanging mirrors. Standalone floor models will have the same effect.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Repair it.</strong></p>
    <p>In most cases, you will have to get any needed repairs done anyway. So, do them before you show your home. That way buyers will focus on the appealing features of your property, not the minor defects.</p>`,

Other seniors are faced with a more difficult decision. Health and/or mobility concerns may require them to either retrofit their existing home to meet their changing needs, or to seek a more accommodating home.</p>
    <p>The decision can be difficult because many simply don’t want to move. In such cases, especially if mobility challenges are arising, wheelchair accessibility may be necessary, not just at the home’s entrance, but under counters, in bathrooms, and through doorways as well. Ramps, elevators and stair-lifts may also need to be considered.</p>
    <p>In addition, other small changes may need to be contemplated, such as easy-to-find and easy-to-use switches, possibly with remote or hands-free applications, as well as levers for all door handles. The addition of keyless entrances, remote control security and 24/7 monitoring devices will help put many family members at ease. However, in cases where a retrofit is cost-prohibitive, the logical option may well be to seek a bungalow or well-appointed condo that can be more easily adapted.</p>`,

This inspection will ensure that the property doesn’t have any unexpected “issues”. After all, you don’t want to buy a home only to discover that the roof needs to be replaced, immediately, for thousands of dollars.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, you might question whether you really need to invest the few hundred dollars it costs for a professional home inspection. “The home we want to buy looks like it’s in very good shape,” you might be thinking. “I can’t see anything wrong with it.”</p>
    <p>However, a professional home inspector can see things you can’t. When you view a property that’s on the market, you might be able to notice obvious issues, like a crack in the foundation or a dripping faucet. If you’re experienced with home maintenance, you might even notice roofing tiles that look like they’re overdue for replacement.</p>
    <p>But, most people don’t have the equipment, knowledge or experience to identify all the issues a home inspector can.</p>
    <p>A home inspector will, for example, use a special device to check for moisture build-up in the washrooms – which can be an indication of mold. A home inspector will also inspect wiring to make sure everything is safe and compliant with the building code.</p>
    <p>That’s not all.</p>
    <p>Like a determined detective, a home inspector will investigate the property’s structure, electrical and plumbing systems, insulation, and other components – and then report the findings to you. In the end, a professional home inspection gives you peace-of-mind and protects your investment. So, getting one is highly recommended – even for recently built homes.</p>`,

  content: `<p>Sometimes you know a desirable street when you see one. For example, it’s obvious that a home on a cul-de-sac is enticing mainly because there isn’t any through traffic.</p>
    <p>What are the other characteristics of a desirable street that may not be as obvious? Here are just a few:</p>
    <p><strong>Sidewalks</strong>. A sidewalk in front of your home is not only handy, it also adds to the property’s curb appeal. In addition, if you have kids, a sidewalk makes it easier - and safer - for them to play and visit neighborhood friends.</p>
    <p><strong>Mature trees</strong>. Trees lining the street add depth and beauty. Most homeowners value front yard trees and would miss them if they were gone.</p>
    <p><strong>Safety</strong>. Unfortunately, some streets are more prone to crime and other issues requiring police intervention than others. Clearly, homeowners appreciate a street that’s known for being safe and located in a community with a low crime rate.</p>
    <p><strong>Pride-of-ownership</strong>. When considering buying a home, take a walk along the street. Do homeowners take good care of their properties? If so, that sign of pride-of-ownership indicates it’s a great place to own a home.</p>
    <p><strong>Location</strong>. Where the street is located is just as important as its characteristics. Are things you want, such as parks, schools, shopping, etc. nearby? Is the street in a desirable area overall?</p>
    <p><strong>Noise</strong>. This is a characteristic that can be invisible to the home buyer. If the street is in a flight path, or near a busy highway used by rush-hour commuters, you want to know!</p>
    <p>A great street can dramatically add to the enjoyment of a home.</p>`,

  content: `<p>When it comes to home fire safety, a little preparation and precaution go a long way toward ensuring your family, your home, and your valuables are protected.&nbsp; Consider the following important information about preventing, fighting and escaping residential fires.</p>
    <p><strong>Fires and Fire Extinguishers</strong></p>
    <p>Fires are classified into different types, depending on the material burning. Fire extinguishers are similarly classified according to the type of burning materials they are designed to extinguish: A type for paper, wood and natural fabric; B type for grease, oil and combustible fuels; and C type for electrical fires. Since residential fires can involve any type of material, every home should have at least one multi-purpose ABC fire extinguisher that is easy to use. In addition, if you store chemicals, you should have an extinguisher designed for that specific chemical in order to ensure that no adverse reaction is caused by the mixture of the burning chemical with the fire extinguisher solution. For example, a poisonous gas is produced when chlorine comes in contact with ammonia, yet ammonia is found in most Class A extinguishers. Remember that your fire extinguishers should be positioned near (but not too close to) cooking areas, fireplaces and other likely sources of fire, and should be inspected and/or replaced according to safety guidelines.</p>
    <p><strong>Smoke Detectors</strong></p>
    <p>There should be at least one smoke detector on every floor of your home, as well as outside each bedroom in larger homes. If any resident is hearing-impaired, consider strobe-light alarms. To avoid false alarms, only use smoke detectors designed for specific areas. For example, ionization types are best for bedroom areas, and less sensitive photo-electric detectors are better for the kitchen. Some building and safety codes require hard-wired detectors that are permanently connected to AC power, with back-up battery power. Keep all smoke detectors dust-free, and don’t paint them. Remember to test and replace the batteries regularly, and note the units’ expiry dates.</p>
    <p><strong>Security Precautions, Prevention and Protection</strong></p>
    <p>It is wise to do whatever you can to protect your family and valuables by preventing fires, rather than only reacting to them. For instance, experts urge all homeowners to discourage smoking indoors, especially in bedrooms, and to be wary of purchasing flammable fabrics and furnishings, or unsafe, unapproved building materials. It’s also recommended that you ensure that your priceless valuables and critical financial records are kept in a fire-proof safe, preferably away from home, or that you keep copies of critical documents elsewhere. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>`,

    <ol type="1">
    <li>Make each room look as spacious as possible. This may mean putting some items, and even some furniture, into storage.  </li>
    <li>Remove unnecessary items from countertops, tables and shelves.</li>
    <li>Keep decorative objects on shelves, tables and even sofas, in odd number groupings. According to Barb Schwartz, the originator of staging, this combination works best. So, put three pillows on a sofa, not two or four.</li>
    <li>Make an older-looking piece of furniture look quaint and stylish by adding a throw cover.</li>
    <li>Add life and good looks to just about any living space by adding flowers or a flowering plant.</li>
    <li>Have the table set with your best china. It makes the buyer want to move in and sit down for dinner!</li>
    <li>Consider replacing the sink, faucets and toilet to make an older bathroom look much better. It’s relatively quick and inexpensive.</li>

  content: `<p>Shopping for a new home can be intimidating. With so many things to do and think about, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Here are some good tips for making the home hunting process a lot easier and much less stressful.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Get your mortgage arranged in advance.</strong> </p>
    <p>You don’t want to find the ideal home on the market, only to face problems arranging a suitable mortgage. You might end up losing the opportunity. So, make mortgage arrangements in advance by getting “pre-approved”. With that pre-approval, you can shop for a new home with confidence.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Clearly define the kind of home you want, and the area you want to live in.</strong> </p>
    <p>You can’t view every home that’s on the market. If you try, you’ll burn yourself out! So, write down a clear description of the kind of home you want. How many bedrooms? Big kitchen? Pool? Don’t forget to include the community. Upscale? Close to downtown? Lots of trees and parks? Urban and close to shopping and entertainment? With this information, a shortlist of properties can be created that meet your criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Take good notes.</strong> </p>
    <p>After viewing a few homes, you may easily start to forget the details. Was it the first property that had the large elm tree in the backyard or was that the fourth property you saw? If you take good notes, you’ll be better able to make decisions later on about which homes to shortlist.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Take care of yourself, and your family.</strong> </p>
    <p>Eat right. Pace yourself. Don’t try to view too many homes in one evening or on one Saturday afternoon.</p>`,

  content: `<p>Remember the last time you visited an upscale furniture showroom? The furniture and fixtures on display probably looked great. The colors and textures jumped out at you. It was a feast for the eyes!</p>
    <p>There is a good reason why: <strong><em>Lighting</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>Of course, the quality of the products has a lot to do with how appealing they look when on display. But smart retailers know that proper lighting is key to making those products look their best. In fact, some retailers even hire lighting consultants!</p>
    <p>What does this have to do with selling your home quickly, and for the best price?</p>
    <p>Obviously, when showing your property to potential buyers, you want your home to look its very best. Proper lighting can be a big help.</p>
    <p>When preparing your home for sale, review the lighting in each room and make sure the space is sufficiently well lit. You want the lighting to be strong enough to prevent dark or shadowy areas, yet not so strong that it’s uncomfortable for the eyes.</p>
    <p>Pay particular attention to traditionally dark areas, such as the garage and closets. Make sure those areas are bright too.</p>
    <p>If you have a viewing scheduled during the day, take advantage of natural light through windows. Open the curtains!</p>
    <p>Finally, one of the most important areas is the foyer. Always make sure the entrance has sufficient lighting.</p>`,

    <p>Although the most common type of door is the traditional solid 6-panel door, there are many other choices available. Want to add light and a greater sense of space to a room? Consider a door with glass panels. Do you have an interior door that gets in the way when opened? Change it to a bi-fold door, which cuts the distance of the swing in half.</p>
    <p>There are also specialty doors that are designed to block noise, and sliding doors that tuck neatly into the wall when opened.</p>
    <p>Interior doors are typically much less expensive than their exterior counterparts. So, making the decision to upgrade or add a door to a room is an affordable design option.</p>
    <p>Visit a door showroom and explore the possibilities.</p>`,

    </table>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>1. Will a renovation truly fix what you don’t like about your property?</strong></p>
    <p>If you’re tired of a small kitchen, for example, given the layout of your house, it might not be possible to make it any bigger. On the other hand, if you’re craving a spacious rec room with a cozy fireplace, then a renovation could make that happen.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are some things you may want that aren’t specific to your house, such as an easier commute or nearby park. Those are features you may only be able to get by moving.</p>
    <p><strong>2. How much will a renovation cost? How does that compare to the cost of moving to a new home?<br /></strong><br />It’s important to get accurate estimates of both the cost to renovate, and the cost of a new home, so you can make an informed decision. </p>
    <p>Renovations often have a habit of costing more than you originally anticipate. Remember, the final result should be a home you want to stay in for quite some time.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Beware of compromising versus settling.<br /></strong><br />Whichever decision you make &#8211; to renovate or to sell &#8211; you can expect to have to make at least some compromises. That’s normal.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the impact of adding an extension to your house. It would be a major renovation. Is it the ideal way to get the extra room you want? Do the benefits of renovating outweigh the benefits of finding a new larger home that already includes the space you need?</p>`,

  content: `<p>Imagine if you dreamed of owning a special limited-edition vehicle. What would you do to ensure that your dream vehicle would someday be parked in your driveway &#8211; with your name on the ownership papers?</p>
    <p>You would probably start by doing some research. You’d find out how much that vehicle would cost, what features are available, and so forth. You would likely visit a local dealership and take a test drive if a model is available on site. You would keep an eye on the market for any that come up and let the dealer know you’re looking for just that car.</p>
    <p>If you did, then, someday, you’d probably be the proud owner of the limited-edition car of your dreams.</p>
    <p>What does this have to do with real estate?</p>
    <p>Well, you can take the same approach when there’s a community you’d love to live in someday. You can target it, learn what homes typically cost in that area, and keep your eye on that market in case a property becomes available that meets your criteria.</p>
    <p>By focusing on a specific community, you increase your chances of someday living there, simply because you’re focusing on it.</p>
    <p>Of course, community targeting isn’t as simple as aiming to own a specific car someday. That’s why you need a real estate professional who can keep an eye on that community on your behalf, and alert you to opportunities that become available.</p>
    <p>Then, if a listing that’s a good fit comes on the market, you can decide whether or not to make a move.</p>`,

    <p>George was funny. The problem is not. Here are some low-cost ideas for quickly creating storage space for your stuff.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Attach a cloth pouch or thin plastic basket to the inside of cupboard doors. This is a great way to store Tupperware lids, cosmetics, etc.</li>
    <li>Install hooks inside the foyer closet for loose items such as hats and scarfs.</li>
    <li>Use egg cartons to make effective storage inserts in drawers.</li>
    <li>Fashion stores often put purchases in stiff, high-quality boxes. Placed on their sides, these make effective storage compartments. (Shoeboxes are especially effective.)</li>
    <li>Consider using suitcases for out-of-season clothing. In addition to storage, they also provide protection.</li>

    <p>There are a couple of things to consider:</p>
    <p>First, think about the last time you purchased a car. You probably had a price range in mind and a general idea of the kind of vehicle you wanted. After visiting a few dealerships &#8211; or shopping online &#8211; you probably discovered seven or eight models that fit your criteria.</p>

    <p>Is it possible that you still won’t find a home that’s absolutely perfect for you in every way? Of course it is. However, there is an excellent chance you’ll get into a property that has everything you need and most, if not all, of what you want.</p>

  content: `<p>As technology evolves and becomes more affordable, homeowners should consider replacing their older equipment with a completely new security system, rather than patching together outdated units that provide specific functions in isolation.</p>
    <p>A modern system will wake you up in the morning to your own personalized display screen, adjust your room temperature, turn on your lights and operate other household functions. When you leave the house, wireless technology will allow you to watch your property, both inside and out, from any number of computing devices. This means you can also program household functions from afar.</p>
    <p>These newer residential security systems can coordinate a wide range of functions by remote control, from locking windows and closing the garage door, to adjusting the thermostat, drapery and lighting. They can even notify you if a room has been entered or a cabinet has been opened. Commercial-type closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV) with live video feed are also being introduced to residential systems in many average-sized homes. In addition, these modern systems coordinate driveway and doorway cameras (connected to your home computer or TV), monitor for break-ins, provide smoke and CO2 detection, and include water sensors for the detection of a burst pipe, leaking water tank or an overflowing tub.</p>
    <p>In the near future, residential video surveillance will distinguish pets from people, and even burglars from letter carriers. The latest CCTV cameras can identify intruders using motion or heat sensors or even activity pattern recognition (e.g. climbing a fence or jimmying a lock).</p>`,

    <p>If you plan to put your home on the market, you want your home to look as attractive as possible from the street. Fortunately, there are many simple things you can do to improve curb appeal.</p>
    <p>For example, you can trim shrubs and hedges, plant flowers, clean the walkway and driveway, paint the front door and garage door, and clean the exteriors of the windows. All these projects are relatively easy and inexpensive. Yet, each can have a dramatic impact on a buyer’s first impression.</p>
    <p>Don’t be like the great restaurant that’s hidden behind an unkept façade. Make sure your curb appeal reflects the overall value of your property.</p>

    <p>That doesn’t mean you must do a major renovation. However, you should do what you can to make the kitchen as attractive as possible to buyers.</p>
    <p>Here are some ideas:</p>
    <p>First, clear the countertops. Put away the toaster and other items. You want to make the entire countertop area seem as spacious as possible.</p>
    <p>If the cabinetry is old, you can spruce it up by installing new knobs, handles and other hardware. A fresh coat of paint on the walls and ceiling can also make the kitchen look like it has had a major renovation &#8211; but will only cost a few hundred dollars. According to an article on the website HGTV.com. “The fastest, most inexpensive kitchen updates include painting and new cabinet hardware.”</p>
    <p>Replacing the countertops is a more expensive renovation, but may be worthwhile if the current counters are old and worn.</p>
    <p>Finally, when preparing your kitchen for a viewing, make sure it’s clean and tidy. The garbage and recycling bins should be empty. Buyers will open cabinets, so make sure items on shelves are neatly organized with the front labels facing forward.</p>`,

Perhaps you’re looking for a large deck surrounded by picturesque landscaping, a beautiful kitchen with gleaming marble countertops, or a cozy living room with a fireplace.</p>
    <p>You should be looking for the ideal home. You deserve it! But some home buyers become fixated on finding the “perfect” property, and pass too quickly on those homes that don’t quite measure up.</p>
    <p>That can be a mistake, because some of those less-than-perfect properties have the potential to become your next dream home.</p>
    <p>First, a home that is lacking some desirable features will probably cost less. Those savings may be more than enough to cover any needed upgrades or renovations.</p>
    <p>Secondly, if you look at a home in terms of its potential, rather than the features it happens to have now, there will be more properties available on the market for you to consider.</p>
    <p>If you’re determined to have a large wrap-around deck for entertaining, for example, don’t cross homes off your list that don’t have this feature. At least not yet. Instead, view these properties with an eye on potential. Is the backyard big enough to accommodate a large deck? How would that deck look if it were added to this particular property? How much would such a renovation cost?</p>
    <p>There’s no doubt about it. You want to find a home that has the features and characteristics you want. But, keep an open mind. Sometimes a “diamond in the rough” can &#8211; with an upgrade or renovation &#8211; become a home you’ll treasure for years.</p>`,

    <p>Of course, all of those things add warmth and meaning to your home. However, if you’re preparing your home for sale, it’s a good idea to pack those memories away &#8211; at least until you’ve sold your property and moved to your new home. Why? Those pleasant mementos that mean so much to you may actually turn off potential buyers.</p>

    <p>So, to help sell your home quickly, make it look great, but not personalized. Think of the showroom displays you see set up in furniture stores.

  content: `<p>If you’ve ever been on a cruise ship, you know that rough waters can result in a miserable experience. Even on modern ships equipped with stabilizers, choppy seas and bad weather can leave you stuck below deck - and possibly sea sick!<br />In fact, the expression “smooth sailing” comes from a desire for calm waters.</p>
    <p>When you sell your property, you’ll want smooth sailing too! You’ll want the experience to be as nondisruptive as possible, while also having plenty of qualified buyers interested in your listing. In the end, you’ll want the transaction to get done without a hitch.</p>
    <p>So how do you ensure that happens? Here are some things you can do to help:</p>
    <p>Think of your home as a product. Potential buyers are more likely to become interested in a product that looks clean, uncluttered and well-maintained.</p>
    <p>Price it right. If your property is listed too high, potential buyers won’t come. If it’s listed too low, you may leave money on the table. (Potentially thousands.) Setting the price will be one of the most important decisions you’ll need to make when selling your home.</p>
    <p>Don’t be there during showings. As your real estate agent, I will take buyers through your property and show them all the great features. If you’re there, some buyers may not feel comfortable and may leave before they have had a chance to become interested.</p>
    <p>Be flexible. This is especially important, when it comes to showing appointments, negotiations, home inspections, closing dates, etc. It’s okay to be firm on some things, just not everything!</p>
    <p>The best tip of all? Use me as your real estate agent and I will make the entire experience of selling your home trouble-free and successful.</p>
    <p>In other words, let me help make it smooth sailing!</p>`,

  content: ` <p>Let’s face it. Life can get complicated, complex and stressful very easily. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to simplify your life, especially at home. Here are some tips from the experts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Don’t be ruled by the TV guide. Instead, select the shows you want to watch and record them. That way, you can watch what you want at the times that are most convenient for you.</li>
        <li>Prepare some meals in advance and freeze them. Simply heat them up as needed. That will reduce a lot of after-work, “gotta-get-dinner-ready” stress.</li>
        <li>Create a weekly dinner menu. It takes some time to prepare, but it allows you to shop effectively, and greatly reduces the stress of figuring out what to cook each day.</li>
        <li>Don’t accumulate stuff you don’t want or need. Give those things away.</li>
        <li>Simplify your cleaning by dividing tasks into 10 minute chunks (such as vacuuming the living room.) Then, fit those tasks in whenever you have 10 minutes to spare.</li>
        <li>To avoid clutter, adopt the “touch it once” rule, which simply means you put things where they belong right away.</li>
        <li>Limit the time you and others in your family spend checking emails and text messages. Consider having an hour or two of “no screen” time each evening.</li>
        <li>Develop healthy routines, such as evening walks and family board game night.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few ideas. If you want to simplify your home life, you can probably brainstorm several other strategies and habits you can try. The idea is to make your home an enjoyable place to be &#8211; for you and your family.</p>`,

    New synthetic fabric dumpsters offer a flexible method of holding and disposing of renovation waste &#8211; without the need to order a large and unsightly metal bin that sits on your front lawn or driveway for weeks on end.
    <br/>
    The industry calls them FIBC’s, or Flexible Intermediate Bulk Containers, but they’re more commonly known as big bags, bulk bags, bagsters and super sacks.
</p>
<p>These durable trash containers can be purchased and taken home (or delivered) for indefinite use, then picked up for a preset fee when full.</p>
<p>When the bag is picked up, another bag is dropped off. Available through specialty suppliers or through some home renovation stores, these “soft bins” are easy to move when empty, and they take up much less space than large metal dumpsters. They also take much less time to fill up, so you’ll have a tidier renovation site and less of an eyesore on your property.</p>`,

  content: `<p>Whether you’re considering buying a particular home, selling your current property &#8211; or doing both &#8211; a home inspection can help.</p>
    <p>This inspection is conducted by a qualified professional who takes a close look at every aspect of a home &#8211; structure, wiring, plumbing, and more &#8211; and identifies issues you may not have noticed yourself.</p>
    <p>For example, a home inspector can determine that a furnace will need to be replaced soon, or that there is a water leak that needs to be fixed.</p>
    <p>You’ll definitely want to get a professional home inspection before you buy a particular property. That’s why most offers to purchase a home are conditional upon passing a home inspection. (The last thing you want is to buy your dream home only to discover that the wiring needs to be updated!)</p>
    <p>You may also want to get a home inspection on your own home before you list it for sale. A certificate from a qualified professional that states that your home passed inspection will make your property more attractive to buyers.</p>
    <p>Many reputable home inspectors are members of a professional industry association. However, it’s important to note that certification or licensing is not a requirement in many jurisdictions. So, select a home inspector carefully.</p>`,

  content: `<p>When you show your home to prospective buyers, there is probably a long list of things you’re hoping they’ll notice. For example, you’ll want them to see the beautiful chandelier in the foyer or the spacious backyard and large deck, or the kitchen with the island big enough for a whole family to sit down for breakfast.<br />But what about those things you’re hoping buyers will not notice?</p>
    <p>Every home has some features that are less than enticing to the typical buyer. You may not be able to do much about a small kitchen or a home backing onto a noisy main street.</p>
    <p>However, there are several things buyers don’t want to see that you can change. Here are five of the most common:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Clutter.</strong> Closets stuffed full of clothes or rooms crammed with too much furniture are distractions. Clutter of any kind makes buyers feel uneasy &#8211; and gets in the way of showcasing the wonderful features of your home.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance issues.</strong> Buyers definitely don’t want to see a lot of things that need repairs or replacement, such as dripping faucets, faded or chipped walls, or overgrown lawns and shrubbery.</li>
    <li><strong>Smells.</strong> Of course, you can’t see smells. But buyers will notice the lingering aroma of exotic cooking, cigarette smoke, and pets. These smells may even limit the amount of time they want to spend exploring the home.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal items.</strong> Buyers will understand that a family is living in the home they’re viewing. However, constant reminders &#8211; in the form of vacation pictures, trophies, or scattered children’s toys &#8211; can make a buyer feel like an intruder.</li>
    <li><strong>You.</strong> It’s nothing personal, but buyers prefer to view your home without you in it.<br />Fortunately, all these things can be easily dealt with before you show your home.</li>

    <p>But home security doesn’t end with locks and alarms. There are other less obvious ways to keep your home safe. For example:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Install exterior lights with a motion detection feature. A light suddenly going on will almost always send a potential intruder away.</li>
    <li>Look for &#8211; and, if possible, eliminate &#8211; potential hiding spots around your property.</li>
    <li>Always leave some lights on in your home when you’re away for an evening.</li>
    <li>Never announce that you’re on vacation or otherwise away from your home on social media sites. (Ask your kids not to do this either!)</li>
    <li>Don’t leave tempting valuables where they can be easily seen through a window.</li>

  content: `<p>It’s not uncommon for couples with growing families to trade in their compact cars for something roomier, like a mini-van. The same thing happens with homes. Sometimes families simply outgrow them.</p>
    <p>How can you tell if that’s happening with your property? Here are some sure-fire signs:</p>
    <p><strong>1 &#8211; You need more space.<br /></strong>This is the most common reason people upgrade to a new home. They need more room. For any number of reasons, you might want an extra bedroom, a larger living room, a bigger backyard, or a more spacious kitchen. Rather than put up with feeling cramped, consider exploring the extra space a new home can provide.</p>
    <p><strong>2 &#8211; A renovation won’t fix it.</strong><br />Sometimes, when a property doesn’t fit its owners’ needs anymore, they consider a renovation. For example, if they need more space for a home office, they convert a spare room. However, a renovation doesn’t always fix the problem. For example, building a double, rather than single driveway and garage, may not be possible given the constraints of your property. Only a new home can solve that problem.</p>
    <p><strong>3 &#8211; You’re interested in a new area.<br /></strong>The community may have been perfect for you at one time. But needs evolve. You may now be looking for something the area doesn’t provide &#8211; like closer access to a recreational activity your family enjoys, or a more convenient commute to work. If that’s the case, it might be time to look at other communities you’d like to consider, and see what types of homes are currently available there.</p>
    <p><strong>4 &#8211; It’s time for a change.<br /></strong>Sometimes you simply feel it’s time for a change. There’s nothing wrong with that. Don’t feel you need a practical reason to sell and find a new home. If this feels like the right time for you and your family to move, go for it.</p>`,

  content: `<p>It’s amazing how much damage water can cause. Just two gallons of water from a burst pipe or overflowing toilet can wreak havoc throughout your home and necessitate thousands of dollars in repairs. Ouch!<br />What should you do at the first sign of water leakage?</p>
    <p>First, stop the source. Turn off the nearest water valve. If you can’t find it, turn off the main water valve to your home.</p>
    <p>Next, do everything you can to soak up as much water as possible. If necessary, lift carpeting. Pay particular attention to water settling next to walls or inside ductwork. Get these areas dry as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>Contain the water. This is important. Do your best to prevent water from infiltrating other rooms to prevent further damage.</p>
    <p>Once the area is as dry as possible, run fans in the room along with a good dehumidifier &#8211; for at least a full day &#8211; to draw in the remaining moisture.</p>
    <p>If, despite your best efforts, you suspect that moisture remains inside the walls, floors or ceilings, call in the professionals. There are many companies that specialize in emergency water damage control. The key is to prevent the possibility that remaining moisture will provide an environment for mould to grow.</p>
    <p>Also, consider contacting your insurance company. They’re as motivated as you are to reduce the damage.</p>`,

  content: `<p>Are you making a New Year’s resolution this month? Whether it’s to quit smoking, lose weight, or spend more time with your family, you’ll have a much better chance of success if you turn that goal into a learning goal instead.<br />A learning goal is simply a commitment to learn something rather than to achieve a specific milestone.</p>
    <p>Say, for example, that your New Year’s resolution is to get into better physical shape. A traditional goal might be: “I’m going to work out at the gym three days a week.” A corresponding learning goal would be: “I’m going to hire a fitness trainer to teach me an appropriate workout program.”</p>
    <p>Research, published in many journals, reveals that people who set learning goals are much more likely to achieve them. They also tend to stay motivated over a longer period of time and get better results overall. So, if you set a learning goal instead of a traditional goal in the area of fitness, you stand a much better chance of actually getting fit!</p>
    <p>Tired of New Year’s resolutions that go nowhere? Try setting a learning goal instead. It just might make 2024 your best year ever!</p>`,

If, for example, buyers don’t realize there is a great school just a couple of blocks away, they might cross your property off their shortlist.<br />An effective way to make sure something like that doesn’t happen is to create three lists.</p>
    <p><strong>1: The “I’ll miss it” list.</strong> Chances are, there are things about your home that you’re really going to miss when you move. One of those may be the spacious living room that’s ideal for entertaining or the nearby park with scenic trails that are perfect for walking and biking.</p>
    <p>Whatever you’ll miss, put it on the list! Chances are, those are features that will also interest buyers.</p>
    <p><strong>2: The “Just the facts” list.</strong> What are the facts about your property that a buyer needs to know in order to consider purchasing it? This may be a very long list including such items as total square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, property taxes, size of yard, and more.</p>
    <p><strong>3: The “repairs and improvements” list.</strong> Buyers are interested in the state of repair of your home, and in any improvements you have made to it. On this list include all repairs you have done during the past three years and, if possible, attach receipts. It’s especially important to include anything that has been replaced, such as the furnace or roof shingles.</p>`,

    <p>Is that day today or a few years down the road?</p>
    <p>Here’s a quick way to make that assessment.</p>
    <p>First, make a list of all the&nbsp;<em>practical</em>&nbsp;reasons why it might be time to move up. Those reasons might include features such as: more bedrooms; proximity to work and school; a larger backyard with trees; nearby parks and walking paths; and, better access to things you enjoy, like theater.</p>
    <p>Next, make a list of the&nbsp;<em>emotional</em>&nbsp;reasons for making such a move. Those reasons might include memorable get-togethers with friends on a more spacious deck; an easier and less stressful commute to work; more family time with the kids; and, enjoyable Saturday golf at a nearby course.</p>
    <p>Finally, take a&nbsp;<em>financial</em>&nbsp;snapshot to determine if you can afford to move up. You’ll need to get a good idea of what your current property will sell for in today’s market, the average price of homes in your desired neighborhood, and how much mortgage you can afford.</p>
    <p>Once you have all of that down on paper, you’ll have a clear picture of your readiness. If the practical and emotional reasons for buying up are compelling, and you can afford to make the move, then, you have your answer.</p>
    <p>The time to move is now!</p>
    <p>By the way, if you need help in making this determination &#8211; especially figuring out what<br />your home will likely sell for, call today.</p>`,

    <p>This may seem like a trivial concern. But, if you’ve invested thousands of dollars in a new living room set, you’re going to be very disappointed if it looks too crowded in your new home.</p>
    <p>Here’s a tip: measure rooms in your current home that contain the furniture you like most. This could be the living room, rec room, master bedroom or even the patio. Then imagine how much smaller &#8211; if at all &#8211; that room could be while still accommodating the furniture.</p>
    <p>When you view properties on the market, take those measurements with you. That way, you’ll be able to quickly determine if room sizes are going to be an issue.</p>`,

The playground where they hung out with their friends? The quiet cul-de-sac where they learned to ride their bikes? The park where they picnicked and flew kites?<br />Lasting memories are built in neighborhoods where amenities match lifestyles. When shopping for a new home, evaluate a prospective new neighborhood against the following 3 E’s:</p>
    <p><strong>Education:</strong> What resources are available in the neighborhood to help with your child’s education? Are there schools and other services, such as libraries or art studios? How do they rate?</p>
    <p><strong>Environment: </strong>Is it safe? Do your kids need to cross busy streets to go to parks or to school? Are there other families with kids the same age?</p>
    <p><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Swimmers need pools and soccer players need a field. Are the right facilities, programs, and leagues available for your kids? Where will you play as a family?</p>
    <p>Keep the 3 E’s in mind when choosing your next neighborhood. You’ll start a lifetime of wonderful memories for you &#8211; and your kids.</p>`,

  content: `<p>You turn on the television and watch a news story about housing prices going down. Then you read an article about the housing market on the upswing again.</p>
    <p>It’s a little like being on a roller-coaster ride!</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the ride isn’t much fun if you’re thinking of buying or selling a home. In fact, it can be very confusing and frustrating. You just don’t know if “now” is the right time to make a move.</p>
    <p>In reality, the housing market has been fluctuating for decades. Yet, people sell their homes every day for good prices, and just as many people get into their next dream home affordably.</p>
    <p>When you hear news of market fluctuations, there are two important things to consider.</p>
    <p>First, a lot of media information about the housing market is national, or at least regional. If the housing market is trending up or down nationally, remember that it doesn’t necessarily mean that your LOCAL market is doing the same. In fact, it’s entirely possible for housing prices to be rising in your neighbourhood, while they are falling nationally, and vice versa.</p>
    <p>Second, if you’re selling your current property while buying another home, then the net effect of market fluctuations may cancel out. Say, for example, that the local market is on the upswing. You’ll probably be able to sell your current home for a good price. However, the home you purchase will likely also be priced to reflect the upswing. The same holds true when the market is down.</p>
    <p>All that being said, there are some circumstances in which you need to consider market fluctuations when deciding whether or not to make a move. Call today for more information.</p>`,

  content: `<p>You’re standing by your window admiring the view. Then you notice it. Moisture has built up around the edges of the glass. Should you worry?<br />It all depends on the reason for the build up.</p>
    <p>Assuming you have traditional double-pane glass in your windows, there are a few things to look for if you notice moisture.</p>
    <p>Often, moisture at the bottom of your windows is simply caused by too much humidity in your indoor air. If that’s the case, simply adjust your humidifier.</p>
    <p>If the moisture is on the outside of the window, typically there’s also no problem with the window itself. It may have rained recently, or the outside humidity may have spiked causing the accumulation. Generally, there’s no reason for concern.</p>
    <p>However, if the moisture is in between the two panes of glass, the seal has broken and surrounding air &#8211; along with its water content &#8211; has made its way in. This disrupts the thermal barrier of the window, reducing its energy efficiency. In fact, the glass might feel noticeably colder than your other windows on chilly days. In that case, you’ll need to replace the pane.</p>
    <p>Similarly, if the moisture is coming in through only one spot &#8211; the bottom right corner for example &#8211; then you might have a leak. If you have a wood frame or sill, you may also notice a growing water stain. It’s important to get leaks fixed quickly. There may be water damage occurring within the frame that you cannot see.</p>

Three-legged stools are okay, but still unstable. Four-legged stools are rock solid.<br />What does this have to do with shopping for a new home?</p>
    <p>Well, if you want to find the right home quickly and for the best price, you need to have four things in place &#8211; the four legs of the stool. They will help ensure the experience goes smoothly.</p>
    <p>The first leg is your wish list. You need to have a clear picture of the type of home you want. How many bedrooms? A large deck? Don’t forget about the community. Do you need to be close to major highways for ease of commuting?</p>
    <p>The second leg is a pre-approved mortgage. Getting the financing handled upfront takes the guesswork out of what you can afford. And, sellers are more likely to take any offers you make more seriously.</p>
    <p>The third leg is realistic expectations. Of homes that sell, 99% sell at or near their current market values. That doesn’t mean you can’t find a good deal. It does mean you’re unlikely to find a “steal”. Fortunately, there are likely several wonderful properties available within your price range.</p>
    <p>The final leg of the stool is a great real estate professional. Choosing the right real estate professional is crucial to making your home shopping experience less stressful and more productive.</p>
    <p>So, when you’re hunting for a new home, make sure you start with a stable “four-legged stool”. It will dramatically increase your chances of finding a home that fits your needs and budget.</p>

    <p><strong>The Kids’ Bedrooms<br /></strong><em>Obvious:</em> They need to be clean and uncluttered. (Good luck!)<br /><em>Not-so-obvious: </em>Arrange stuffed animals, games and other toys like an attractive display in a toy store. It’s okay to have a toy, like a racetrack, out of the box.

    <p>Then, make sure your hot water tank and/or pipes are not sweating. While you’re at it, consider turning down the tank thermostat by a couple of degrees &#8211; chances are you won’t notice a difference, except hopefully on your energy bill.</p>

    There’s a famous saying in the real estate business: “Location, location, location”. It simply means that where your home is located &#8211; your community &#8211; is just as important to potential buyers as the features of the property itself.
    <br/>
    Sellers often make the mistake of creating a long list of home features while ignoring community features. They tout the spacious kitchen, and the newly renovated bathrooms, but say little about the area.
</p>
<p>So, when you’re ready to sell your home, sit down and create two lists: home features and community features. Buyers want to know both.</p>
<p>On the community features list, include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Locations of schools and daycares.</li>
    <li>Major retailers and shopping areas.</li>
    <li>Proximity to major commuting routes.</li>
    <li>Theatres, night clubs and other entertainment.</li>
    <li>Rinks, gyms and other sporting facilities.</li>
    <li>Green space, walking trails, and ponds.</li>

Better lighting can boost your energy, help you sleep better, and even enhance healing.<br />So, it pays to make sure the lighting in your home has a positive impact on the health of your family.</p>
    <p>Start by enhancing sources of natural light, such as windows and skylights. Study each room of your home and replace as much of the artificial light as possible with sunlight. For example, reposition a favourite reading chair next to a window.</p>
    <p>Consider dimming the lighting in your home during the evenings. If your home is very bright when it’s dark outside, it can affect your body’s natural rhythms, resulting in disturbed sleep.</p>
    <p>Avoid over-lighting, which is common in rooms where there are few windows. Over time, excessive light can cause headaches and even mood changes. Lighting that is sufficient to see everything clearly is all you need.</p>`,

To figure that out, you’ll not only need to know how much your house will likely sell for, but also the selling costs you are likely to incur in the process.<br />The costs of selling vary depending on a number of factors. Here’s a general rundown of what to consider:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Repairs. </em></strong>You will want your house to look its best to buyers. That may require you to get any needed repairs done before listing. You don’t want a buyer to see a dent in the wall or a dripping faucet.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Renovations.</strong></em> It might make sense to get a few improvements done to make the house more attractive. For example, you may want to replace old and worn kitchen countertops.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Legal fees.</em></strong> Selling a house requires a lot of legal work. You’ll need a good real estate lawyer to take care of that for you.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Commissions.</em></strong> This is usually calculated as a percentage of the sale price.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Moving costs.</em></strong> Once you sell, you’ll obviously need to move! So, factoring in this expense is a smart idea.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although this may seem like a long list, selling costs are fairly easy to estimate. Once you have that number, it’s easy to calculate how much money you’ll have available to put towards your next home.</p>`,

    <p><strong>Check the furnace filter.</strong> This is one of the most overlooked maintenance items in the home. Any furnace repair person can tell you stories about filters they’ve seen caked in dust. Make sure those aren’t yours. Air passes through those filters before circulating throughout your home. Replacing a filter takes less than five minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Clean the drains. </strong>Drains are a surprisingly common source of smells in the home. Most people only clean them when they’re clogged, but they should be flushed thoroughly with a good-quality cleaner at least once a season.</p>
    <p><strong>Turn on the bathroom fan.</strong> Not only do bathroom fans remove smells, they also reduce moisture build-up. About 50% of air pollutants originate from some type of moisture. Mould is the worst of these pollutants. Professionals recommend you keep your bathroom fan on for at least 30 minutes after a shower.</p>
    <p><strong>Clean your doormat.</strong> Even if your doormat doesn’t smell, it can be a source of air pollutants. When people wipe their shoes, they transfer outside ground pollutants from their shoes to your mat.</p>
    <p>Of course, you can always open a window. That’s the most popular and easiest way to freshen the air, and it works.</p>`,

This may be a very long list including such items as total square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, property taxes, size of the lot, and more. This list should also include special features such as upgraded kitchen features and the nearby golf course.</p>

    <p>Buyers are interested in the state of repair of your home, and in any improvements you have made to it. On this list, include all repairs you have done during the past three years and, if possible, attach receipts. It’s especially important to include anything that has been replaced, such as a furnace or roof. If you’ve done any major remodeling or renovations, include the details on those too.</p>

  content: `<p>When considering whether or not to sell their home, many people think about market conditions. They consider whether it’s a buyer’s or seller’s market. They look at trends. They try to time the sale to get the best price for their property.</p>
<p>While market conditions certainly can play a role in deciding whether you should sell now rather than later, many other factors can influence that decision too.</p>
<p>For example, you might have outgrown your home and need more space. Perhaps you need an extra bedroom or a larger kitchen. If you wait until market conditions are perfect, you may languish for months — or even years — in a home that’s too small for you.</p>
<p>The same can be said for downsizing.</p>
<p>Another “non-market” reason you might want to sell your home sooner rather than later is the neighbourhood. Is there another community more suited to your lifestyle that you want to get into? If it’s a particularly desirable area, you don’t want to wait too long to make a move. If you do, you might lose some good opportunities.</p>
<p>There’s also the emotional side of the decision to consider. You might simply want to move for no other reason than you need a change. That’s as good a reason as any to put up the For Sale sign and find your next dream home.</p>
<p>Other non-market reasons for selling include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wanting a shorter commute to work.</li>
<li>Adapting to a change in your family situation.</li>
<li>Wishing to live closer to relatives and friends.</li>
<li>Yearning for a particular property feature, such as a backyard with mature trees.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, don’t just consider market conditions when deciding to sell. Look at all the reasons and then move forward with confidence. After all, you can sell and buy in any market.</p>`,

<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a mat by the front door for shoes, umbrellas, etc.?</li>
<li>Did you air out the home as much as possible to get rid of any lingering smells from a pet, recent cooking, etc.?</li>
<li>Did you empty trash bins?</li>
<li>Is the buyer (or his or her agent) aware of any doors that may have special locking mechanisms? If not, leave a note with instructions. For example, “To open the patio door, pull up the deadbolt lock at the bottom.”</li>
<li>Are there any kids’ toys on the floor that might accidently get damaged or be a tripping hazard?</li>
</ol>

  content: `<p>Is it really possible to improve your kitchen’s look for about the cost of a takeout gourmet dinner with the family?</p>
<p>Obviously you’re not going to be able to do anything major, such as replace the cabinets within that budget. But, there are many surprisingly low-budget ways to spruce up the kitchen. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have old cabinets? You’d be surprised by how much newer they can look simply by replacing the knobs and/or handles. Pick a style that blends, rather than contrasts, with the cabinets.</li>
<li>Does your sink have a few stains? That’s not unusual! There are special cleaning products available to get out the toughest stains without damaging or scratching the sink’s finish.</li>
<li>Lighting can have an enormous impact on the look and feel of a space, particularly the kitchen. Experiment with new lighting ideas. Try different bulb wattages. Consider a new lighting fixture that looks good and distributes the light more pleasantly.</li>
<li>Often you don’t need to upgrade anything – you just need to do a little redecorating. Consider new window coverings. Declutter to create a greater sense of space. Play with design touches such as placing trendy cookbooks on the counter, adding a plant, or putting an attractive fruit basket on the counter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, depending on your choices, some of these ideas may cost you more than $100. However, any of these low-budget improvements can make your kitchen look considerably more attractive.</p>
<p>You’ll notice the difference. And, if you’re selling, so will buyers.</p>

<p>Here are the most common plans you’ll need to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact the post office to get your mail forwarded. No matter how thorough you are in updating your address with companies you deal with regularly, you’re bound to miss a few. Using the mail forwarding service will ensure you get that mail.</li>
<li>Double-check that your home insurance will be transferred on closing day, so your new home is covered from day one. Also, don’t forget to update vehicle and personal insurance (medical, life, etc.)</li>
<li>Make arrangements with utility companies – phone, electricity, heating, etc. – as soon as possible. Remember, you might be closing some accounts and opening new ones. That can take time.</li>
<li>If you are upgrading your internet at the new home, a visit from a technician might be required. Make that appointment now.</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be more arrangements to make before closing day. Create a checklist to make getting it all done easier and less stressful!</p>

  content: `<p>Imagine you find a home on the market that checks all the boxes. There’s only one issue. It needs work. Perhaps the paint has faded, or the kitchen is old, or there are repairs needed.</p>
<p>Should you make an offer on that home? That depends on many factors, of course.</p>
<p>The first thing you should consider is whether or not the home is otherwise ideal. If it has everything you want — location, size, style, number of bedrooms, etc. — then you may only be a few improvements away from a real gem.</p>
<p>You should also consider how much those improvements are likely to cost. Cosmetic projects — such as painting, replacing light fixtures, etc. — tend to be more affordable. In many cases, those projects are also DIY-friendly. However, major improvements, such as upgrading the kitchen with new countertops, sink, and cabinetry, can be expensive.</p>
<p>Fortunately, homes that need work don’t show as well as pristine listings. So, the cost of doing the improvements you need might be offset by getting the home at a lower price.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, buying a home that needs work is definitely worth considering.</p>

  paragraph1:
    "Usually, a home inspection is done after an offer is made to buy a home. The offer will typically include a condition that the property must pass such an inspection.",
  content: ` <p>Usually, a home inspection is done after an offer is made to buy a home. The offer will typically include a condition that the property must pass such an inspection. The buyer then hires the inspector, who goes through the home, top to bottom, inside and out, looking for issues.</p>
<p>However, you can also get an inspection done as the seller. In this case, you are paying for an inspector to produce a report on your home — before you sell. In fact, this is often called a pre-sale home inspection.</p>
<p>Why would you do this?</p>
<p>A pre-sale home inspection can make your property more attractive to buyers. This is especially helpful if you’re selling in a buyer’s market, where there are more homes like yours for sale than there are buyers. The report serves as an enticing feature of your listing because it reassures buyers that there are no unknown issues.</p>
  <p>So, getting a pre-home inspection is something worth considering. For a buyer deciding between your listing and another home for sale, it can be a determining factor.</p>

  content: `<p>Want to save money in 2025? There are many money-saving opportunities — including tax savings — that you can realize if you take action before the year ends. Here are just a few examples of what to consider:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          <strong>Do you own a business?</strong>
            Even if it’s just a side-hustle to make extra money, you can save on taxes if you make planned purchases this month. For example, if you need a new printer, buy it in December. That way, you may be able to take a deduction this year.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Check your subscriptions. </strong>
          Many types of subscriptions — publications, online apps, memberships — automatically renew in December. If you subscribe to something you no longer want, cancel it this month. Otherwise, you might be stuck paying the renewal fee.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Review your investments.</strong>
            Sit down with your advisor and go over your investments and other savings. You may be able to take advantage of year-end opportunities. Also check for investments or financial instruments that may be set to automatically renew this month.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Watch for price hikes.</strong>
            It’s common for companies to raise prices at the beginning of a new year. Review your bills for announcements of fee increases. Some of those may be negotiable. You might also want to make other changes to reduce the impact.
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Taking time this month to review expenses and investments could save you a bundle in 2025. It’s worth the effort!</p>

  content: ` <p>There’s an interesting psychological characteristic of clutter. We tend to notice it more in other people’s homes than in our own. In fact, we may not even realize a room in our house feels cluttered and uncomfortable to visitors.</p>
  <p>That’s why making each room look neat and spacious is so important when you’re selling your property.</p>
  <p>Although the task may seem daunting at first, decluttering is relatively easy to do.</p>
  <p>The simplest technique is to box things. You’re going to move anyway, so boxing makes sense. You can store the boxes of items you’re keeping in your garage. If you have a lot of boxes, renting short-term storage is an option.</p>
  <p>When decluttering, you’re bound to come across items you no longer need or want. You can create separate boxes for items to trash, donate, or sell online. Deal with these right away, so they’re not included in your stored boxes.</p>
  <p>An uncluttered home shows dramatically better to buyers. When they see a cluttered space — even if it’s neatly organized — it creates a reason not to buy. So, declutter your way to a faster sale at a higher price!</p>

    When you purchased your current home, chances are it was a good match for your lifestyle. It had the space you needed, the features you wanted, and a location that worked for you.
    <br/>
    But for most people, lifestyle and needs evolve through the years. Kids get older. Jobs or careers change. People take on new hobbies and other interests.
</p>
<p>As a result, the home that was ideal a few years ago may not fit with your current lifestyle.</p>
<p>That doesn’t necessarily mean you need to shop for a new home! However, it may mean that it’s worth taking a look at the market and seeing what’s possible.</p>
<p>Think about the kind of home that would support your lifestyle today. Ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How many bedrooms do we need?</li>
    <li>How easy is it to travel to work each day?</li>
    <li>What special features do we want in our home? (Big backyard? Rec room? Quiet area?)</li>
    <li>What do we want nearby? (School? Playground? Walking and biking trails? Shopping? Entertainment? Golf?)</li>
    <li>What else does our home need in order to support our lifestyle?</li>
    <li>After asking yourself some of these key questions, ask other family members for their opinions too.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may, in fact, find that the property you have now is still ideal for your lifestyle.</p>
<p>If, however, your home is no longer a good fit, you have options. You can stay in your current home despite it no longer being ideal; you can make some changes (a renovation, perhaps); or, you can see what’s available in the housing market.</p>
<p>If you need help with any of these options, call today.</p>

<p>But, there are also newer composite materials that offer advantages which might make them an ideal compromise between natural and synthetic countertops. Generically known as solid surface, engineered stone or quartz composite, they go by many different brand names, and have unique features not found in other surfaces.</p>
<p>For example, they tend to be harder and more durable and stain resistant than traditional countertops, because they are formed with a combination of natural materials and synthetic bonding compounds. The solid-surface types appear seamless, are made of about 2/3 mineral powders and 1/3 resin, and are available in a range of pigments and designs that sometimes mimic nature (e.g., white marble). The quartz types are closer to 90% natural stone fragments with about 10% resin, so they are even harder by comparison, although the range of pigment and design options is narrower. </p>
<p>Nowadays, with so much to consider, it’s wise to consult a countertop expert about your material options and installation costs.</p>`,

  content: `<p>Remember the last time you were in a furniture store or other major home retailer? Remember the fully decorated displays of furniture, appliances and other products? Some of those may have even been organized as model rooms.</p>
<p>What did most of those displays have in common?</p>
<p>Chances are, they were well lit.</p>
<p>In fact, in the retail industry, there are professionals who specialize exclusively in display lighting. It plays such an important role in showcasing and selling home products successfully that the stores are willing to absorb the expense.</p>
<p>The same holds true for your home.</p>
<p>If you want to show your home well, and sell it quickly and for the best price, make sure every room is well lit.</p>
<p>There are probably some rooms in your home where the lighting is adequate, such as the kitchen and bathrooms, and perhaps the foyer. But there are other areas where the lighting may be mediocre. Take a close look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closets</li>
<li>Storage areas</li>
<li>Bedrooms</li>
<li>Laundry rooms</li>
<li>Hallways</li>
<li>The garage</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are areas in your home that are dark or shadowy, the solution may be as simple as installing higher wattage bulbs, provided your fixture can accommodate them. Keep in mind that brightness can vary significantly from one type of bulb to another. Your goal is to make the room feel bright yet comfortable on the eyes.</p>
<p>Also, don’t forget to open drapes and blinds. Often the best and most pleasant source of light for a room is the sun shining through a window.</p>`,

  content: `<p>There are few certainties in this world, but there are surefire ways to sell your property faster regardless of market conditions. These strategies have been proven time and time again. So, if you’re thinking of selling this year, take a good look at these recommendations:</p>
<p>1. Clean and tidy up. Making your home “guest ready” is the easiest way to ensure buyers are impressed during a viewing.</p>
<p>2. Declutter. The more spacious your home looks, the more impressive it will be to buyers. You can box items and give them away, sell them or put them in storage.</p>
<p>3. Price it right. Deciding on the right listing price is crucial. If it’s too high, you’ll discourage otherwise qualified buyers from seeing your home. If it’s too low, you might send the wrong message to the marketplace.</p>
<p>4. Optimize curb appeal. The better your home looks from the street, the more buyers will become interested. Curb appeal is important because it’s the first impression a buyer makes, and that impression lasts.</p>
<p>5. Stage your home. You don’t necessarily need to replace all the furniture. However, studies consistently confirm that a well-staged home sells significantly faster than a comparable un-staged property.</p>
<p>6. Leverage the latest marketing and selling tactics. You want the marketing of your home to bring in the most qualified and interested buyers. You then want sales strategies that turn those buyers into offers and negotiation skills to turn the right offer into a sale.</p>
<p>Keep these proven strategies in mind when putting your home up for sale.</p>`,
