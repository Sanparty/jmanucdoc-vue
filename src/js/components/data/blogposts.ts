But sometimes a kitchen makeover can be achieved with some simple cosmetic changes, rather than a complete redesign of the actual floor plan.</p>
    <p>   
    Beyond a basic color scheme change, the next makeover level involves replacing cabinet hardware. Remove a set of hinges, knobs and/or pulls to identify the type of screw/bolt settings that will be needed. Then, choose from the many options available at home building centers or specialty knob stores. Similarly, consider a new faucet and sink, upgraded countertop or a fresh tile backsplash. Each will contribute to a dramatic change. You may want to consider replacing or refinishing the drawer and cupboard facings as well, although that would likely require professional help.
    </p>
    <p>
    Improved lighting is another important way to change a kitchen’s look and functionality. However, general overhead lighting, strategic task lighting and ambient mood lighting could involve rewiring. Finally, replacing the flooring will result in a significant change to any kitchen. Choices range from recycled cork to indestructible granite. Remember to consider not only appearance but also practicality.

    <p>Will you need to deal with a Property Surveyor when you sell your home?</p>
    <p>You might.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the mortgage lender will ask for a land survey, especially if your property is older and hasn’t changed hands in many years. You might also be asked for one by the buyer if there is any confusion about the size and boundaries of your property – or if significant changes have been made to it in recent years.</p>
    <p>This is nothing to be concerned about.</p>
    <p>A qualified Property Surveyor will do the appropriate inspections and measurements on your property and issue you the survey.</p>
    <p>Property Surveyors are highly trained and licensed. The profession is represented by their respective governing bodies.</p>
    <p>Before spending the money on a new land survey, make sure you don’t already have one. Hopefully, you’ve stored the paperwork that relates to the purchase of your home. Look through it. A valid land survey might be right there.</p>

    content: `<p>Sometimes we don’t get to choose whether or not to sell our home and buy another one. Circumstances, such as a job relocation, may make that decision for us.</p>
    <p>However, most often, the decision to move is discretionary. Sometimes people move simply because they think it’s a good idea. They feel that “now” is the right time to find their next dream home.</p>
    <p>You may feel you need to find a new home, because you’ve outgrown your current property. Perhaps you have a growing family and require more space. Maybe you’re doing more entertaining and need a larger backyard with a more spacious deck. It could be that the commute to work is arduous and you need to move to a place that’s closer.</p>
    <p>Those “needs” may motivate you to move, but sometimes a “want” can play an important role too.</p>
    <p>For example, you may want to live in a quieter area or in a newly built home that requires less maintenance. Maybe you simply want a change.</p>
    <p>If you’re thinking of making a move, take a moment to write down a list of your needs and wants. Seeing them on paper will help make the decision easier.</p>

    content: `<p>When you see a new home you like on the market, it’s easy to get distracted by all the features you love - the wrap-around backyard deck or the spacious recreation room that has plenty of space for entertaining. You just need to make sure that in all your excitement you don’t overlook any expensive maintenance issues that could be just around the corner.</p>
    <p>Nothing lasts forever. The major components of every home - from the furnace to the roof shingles - need to be replaced eventually. But, knowing when those maintenance issues are likely to arise can help you make a smarter decision about the home you’re considering.</p>
    <p>How do you do that?</p>
    <p>When viewing the property, ask for the age of the major components of the home, such as the roof shingles, furnace, air conditioner, water heater, and appliances. You might think the roof shingles look merely weathered in spots and have years of service left – when in fact, they’re due to be replaced next year.</p>
    <p>Also pay close attention to the backyard deck, fencing, flooring, and windows. Do any of those components look aged, worn, and in need of repair or replacement sometime soon?</p>
    <p>Finally, don’t forget to check the kitchen and bathrooms. Sinks, faucets, bathtubs, showers, and cabinetry have a life-span of about 10-15 years.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are things you can’t see on your own, such as wiring, plumbing, venting, and other components of a property that may require maintenance. That’s why you should always make any offer to purchase a home conditional on passing an inspection by a qualified home inspector.</p>

    content: `<p>It has become standard for retailers to offer low cost supplementary “insurance protection plans” on appliances and electronics. These plans may seem like a good idea, but before you buy one, be sure the plan actually offers real added value. Often, these plans overlap with other protection programs you already have.</p>
    <p>For example, reputable retailers usually sell products with solid manufacturer warranties, because they don’t want the bad reputation or the hassles that come from unhappy customers. In fact, in today’s competitive world, many retailers already have a “satisfaction guaranteed” policy built into everything they sell. In addition, if you are paying by credit card, you may have purchaser protection that is activated by simply using the card.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are many consumer protection plans that do offer reasonable value. For example, some extended warranties offer a safety net after the manufacturer’s warranty runs out (similar to extended warranty automobile plans}. In those cases, be sure the product is one you’ll want to keep and use for the duration of the warranty period. For example, it makes no sense to pay an extra thirty dollars on a one hundred dollar item, if you expect you will be able to buy a newer version in a few years for even less. Some “total care” service plans for complicated equipment, such as a car, computer or HVAC unit, are quite popular, as are “price freezing” plans on home utilities, such as electricity, gas and water. At the end of the day, it all comes down to your confidence in a product or service, and your willingness to put up with (or pay to avoid) the inconvenience of complaining, should it fail to meet your expectations.</p>`,

    <li>Water the lawn, not the sidewalk or driveway.</li>
    <li>Lawns need about an inch of water per week. To determine how much watering time that requires, place an empty tuna tin within your sprinkler’s range, and note how long it takes to fill.</li>
    <li>When watering, account for recent rain.</li>
    <li>Use an automatic sprinkler system that allows you to adjust the area, frequency and/or duration. Set the timer to operate just prior to sunrise.</li>
    <li>Attach rain barrels to downspouts, in order to catch and hold roof runoff and then re-distribute it to your lawn, garden or container plants. Keep it covered for safety reasons, and to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. (Note: rainwater is actually better for plants because it doesn’t contain chlorine and has an ambient temperature).</li>

    content: `<p>If you take care to price your home correctly - that is, at a price that is in line with what similar properties in the area have sold for recently - then you have a good chance of selling it at or near your asking price.</p>
    <p>That doesn’t mean you won’t get a low-ball offer. You might. So, what do you do when that happens?</p>
    <p>First, understand that the buyer may not necessarily be trying to steal away your home at a bargain-basement price. They might simply be mistaken about its true market value. Of course, they might also be coming in at a low price in the hopes they’ll get lucky.</p>
    <p>You will never actually know the buyer’s motives. So, it would be a mistake to get angry or dismiss the offer out-of-hand. That low-ball offer might end up being the beginning of a negotiation that results in the sale of your home at a good price.</p>
    <p>Your first step is to work with a Real Estate Professional to determine:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Whether the buyer is serious.</li>
    <li>Whether the buyer is qualified. (For example, do they have a pre-approved mortgage?)</li>
    <li>How amenable the buyer is to a counter-offer that reflects the true market value of your home.</li>
    <li>What that counter-offer should be.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This isn’t an easy process. It takes the knowledge and experience of a professional real estate agent to get it right.</p>`,

    <p>So, does that mean you should replace your windows?</p>
    <p>That depends on a number of factors. Window replacement can be an expensive renovation. Here are a few things to consider before making your decision.</p>
    <ul type="1">
    <li>Do you see water infiltration or mildew on the interior sides of any of the window sills? This means that moisture is creeping in from the outside, and you need to get those windows repaired or replaced as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>If your windows are double-paned - (two panes of glass) - check for any signs of moisture in between the glass panes. Moisture indicates that the thermal seal is broken and, at a minimum, the glass will need to be replaced.</li>
    <li>Take a look at your windows from the outside. Is the trim rotted or cracked anywhere? Are there dark spots or any signs of rotting on the wood frames? Repairs or replacement may be required.</li>
    <li>Check the operation of your windows. Do they open and close easily? Some windows, such as those in bedrooms, are often designed to be big enough to use as an exit in case of a fire. It’s important to make sure those work properly.</li>
    <li>Finally, are you happy with how your windows look? Do you feel that your property will look significantly better with new windows?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although they are expensive, replacing windows can have a lot of advantages. Depending on the efficiency of your current windows, replacing them could cut your energy costs by 10-20%. In addition, new windows block out more exterior noise, making your home quieter.</p>`,

    <p>Let’s take a look at some of the options available:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Paint it.</strong></p>
    <p>There’s no doubt about it. A fresh coat of paint will significantly improve the appearance of just about any area of your home. In fact, compared to other home improvements, painting will give you the highest return on investment when you sell your property. Think beyond walls. Painting a door, window frame, garage floor or deck can make those features look like new.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Declutter it.</strong></p>
    <p>Eliminating clutter will make your home look more attractive, roomy and comfortable to buyers. Do an inventory of each room. Ask yourself: “What can I throw out? Give away? Sell? Put into storage?”</p>
    <p><strong>3. Put up mirrors.</strong></p>
    <p>Mirrors are a relatively inexpensive design feature. Yet, according to an article in Style At Home magazine, they can make small rooms appear bigger and dark rooms seem brighter. You don’t necessarily need to buy wall-hanging mirrors. Standalone floor models will have the same effect.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Repair it.</strong></p>
    <p>In most cases, you will have to get any needed repairs done anyway. So, do them before you show your home. That way buyers will focus on the appealing features of your property, not the minor defects.</p>`,

    <p>The decision can be difficult because many simply don’t want to move. In such cases, especially if mobility challenges are arising, wheelchair accessibility may be necessary, not just at the home’s entrance, but under counters, in bathrooms, and through doorways as well. Ramps, elevators and stair-lifts may also need to be considered.</p>
    <p>In addition, other small changes may need to be contemplated, such as easy-to-find and easy-to-use switches, possibly with remote or hands-free applications, as well as levers for all door handles. The addition of keyless entrances, remote control security and 24/7 monitoring devices will help put many family members at ease. However, in cases where a retrofit is cost-prohibitive, the logical option may well be to seek a bungalow or well-appointed condo that can be more easily adapted.</p>`,

This inspection will ensure that the property doesn’t have any unexpected “issues”. After all, you don’t want to buy a home only to discover that the roof needs to be replaced, immediately, for thousands of dollars.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, you might question whether you really need to invest the few hundred dollars it costs for a professional home inspection. “The home we want to buy looks like it’s in very good shape,” you might be thinking. “I can’t see anything wrong with it.”</p>
    <p>However, a professional home inspector can see things you can’t. When you view a property that’s on the market, you might be able to notice obvious issues, like a crack in the foundation or a dripping faucet. If you’re experienced with home maintenance, you might even notice roofing tiles that look like they’re overdue for replacement.</p>
    <p>But, most people don’t have the equipment, knowledge or experience to identify all the issues a home inspector can.</p>
    <p>A home inspector will, for example, use a special device to check for moisture build-up in the washrooms – which can be an indication of mold. A home inspector will also inspect wiring to make sure everything is safe and compliant with the building code.</p>
    <p>That’s not all.</p>
    <p>Like a determined detective, a home inspector will investigate the property’s structure, electrical and plumbing systems, insulation, and other components – and then report the findings to you. In the end, a professional home inspection gives you peace-of-mind and protects your investment. So, getting one is highly recommended – even for recently built homes.</p>`,

    <p>What are the other characteristics of a desirable street that may not be as obvious? Here are just a few:</p>
    <p><strong>Sidewalks</strong>. A sidewalk in front of your home is not only handy, it also adds to the property’s curb appeal. In addition, if you have kids, a sidewalk makes it easier - and safer - for them to play and visit neighborhood friends.</p>
    <p><strong>Mature trees</strong>. Trees lining the street add depth and beauty. Most homeowners value front yard trees and would miss them if they were gone.</p>
    <p><strong>Safety</strong>. Unfortunately, some streets are more prone to crime and other issues requiring police intervention than others. Clearly, homeowners appreciate a street that’s known for being safe and located in a community with a low crime rate.</p>
    <p><strong>Pride-of-ownership</strong>. When considering buying a home, take a walk along the street. Do homeowners take good care of their properties? If so, that sign of pride-of-ownership indicates it’s a great place to own a home.</p>
    <p><strong>Location</strong>. Where the street is located is just as important as its characteristics. Are things you want, such as parks, schools, shopping, etc. nearby? Is the street in a desirable area overall?</p>
    <p><strong>Noise</strong>. This is a characteristic that can be invisible to the home buyer. If the street is in a flight path, or near a busy highway used by rush-hour commuters, you want to know!</p>
    <p>A great street can dramatically add to the enjoyment of a home.</p>`,

    content: `<p>When it comes to home fire safety, a little preparation and precaution go a long way toward ensuring your family, your home, and your valuables are protected.&nbsp; Consider the following important information about preventing, fighting and escaping residential fires.</p>
    <p><strong>Fires and Fire Extinguishers</strong></p>
    <p>Fires are classified into different types, depending on the material burning. Fire extinguishers are similarly classified according to the type of burning materials they are designed to extinguish: A type for paper, wood and natural fabric; B type for grease, oil and combustible fuels; and C type for electrical fires. Since residential fires can involve any type of material, every home should have at least one multi-purpose ABC fire extinguisher that is easy to use. In addition, if you store chemicals, you should have an extinguisher designed for that specific chemical in order to ensure that no adverse reaction is caused by the mixture of the burning chemical with the fire extinguisher solution. For example, a poisonous gas is produced when chlorine comes in contact with ammonia, yet ammonia is found in most Class A extinguishers. Remember that your fire extinguishers should be positioned near (but not too close to) cooking areas, fireplaces and other likely sources of fire, and should be inspected and/or replaced according to safety guidelines.</p>
    <p><strong>Smoke Detectors</strong></p>
    <p>There should be at least one smoke detector on every floor of your home, as well as outside each bedroom in larger homes. If any resident is hearing-impaired, consider strobe-light alarms. To avoid false alarms, only use smoke detectors designed for specific areas. For example, ionization types are best for bedroom areas, and less sensitive photo-electric detectors are better for the kitchen. Some building and safety codes require hard-wired detectors that are permanently connected to AC power, with back-up battery power. Keep all smoke detectors dust-free, and don’t paint them. Remember to test and replace the batteries regularly, and note the units’ expiry dates.</p>
    <p><strong>Security Precautions, Prevention and Protection</strong></p>
    <p>It is wise to do whatever you can to protect your family and valuables by preventing fires, rather than only reacting to them. For instance, experts urge all homeowners to discourage smoking indoors, especially in bedrooms, and to be wary of purchasing flammable fabrics and furnishings, or unsafe, unapproved building materials. It’s also recommended that you ensure that your priceless valuables and critical financial records are kept in a fire-proof safe, preferably away from home, or that you keep copies of critical documents elsewhere. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>`,

    <li>Make each room look as spacious as possible. This may mean putting some items, and even some furniture, into storage.  </li>
    <li>Remove unnecessary items from countertops, tables and shelves.</li>
    <li>Keep decorative objects on shelves, tables and even sofas, in odd number groupings. According to Barb Schwartz, the originator of staging, this combination works best. So, put three pillows on a sofa, not two or four.</li>
    <li>Make an older-looking piece of furniture look quaint and stylish by adding a throw cover.</li>
    <li>Add life and good looks to just about any living space by adding flowers or a flowering plant.</li>
    <li>Have the table set with your best china. It makes the buyer want to move in and sit down for dinner!</li>
    <li>Consider replacing the sink, faucets and toilet to make an older bathroom look much better. It’s relatively quick and inexpensive.</li>

    content: `<p>Shopping for a new home can be intimidating. With so many things to do and think about, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Here are some good tips for making the home hunting process a lot easier and much less stressful.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Get your mortgage arranged in advance.</strong> </p>
    <p>You don’t want to find the ideal home on the market, only to face problems arranging a suitable mortgage. You might end up losing the opportunity. So, make mortgage arrangements in advance by getting “pre-approved”. With that pre-approval, you can shop for a new home with confidence.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Clearly define the kind of home you want, and the area you want to live in.</strong> </p>
    <p>You can’t view every home that’s on the market. If you try, you’ll burn yourself out! So, write down a clear description of the kind of home you want. How many bedrooms? Big kitchen? Pool? Don’t forget to include the community. Upscale? Close to downtown? Lots of trees and parks? Urban and close to shopping and entertainment? With this information, a shortlist of properties can be created that meet your criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Take good notes.</strong> </p>
    <p>After viewing a few homes, you may easily start to forget the details. Was it the first property that had the large elm tree in the backyard or was that the fourth property you saw? If you take good notes, you’ll be better able to make decisions later on about which homes to shortlist.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Take care of yourself, and your family.</strong> </p>
    <p>Eat right. Pace yourself. Don’t try to view too many homes in one evening or on one Saturday afternoon.</p>`,

    content: `<p>Remember the last time you visited an upscale furniture showroom? The furniture and fixtures on display probably looked great. The colors and textures jumped out at you. It was a feast for the eyes!</p>
    <p>There is a good reason why: <strong><em>Lighting</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>Of course, the quality of the products has a lot to do with how appealing they look when on display. But smart retailers know that proper lighting is key to making those products look their best. In fact, some retailers even hire lighting consultants!</p>
    <p>What does this have to do with selling your home quickly, and for the best price?</p>
    <p>Obviously, when showing your property to potential buyers, you want your home to look its very best. Proper lighting can be a big help.</p>
    <p>When preparing your home for sale, review the lighting in each room and make sure the space is sufficiently well lit. You want the lighting to be strong enough to prevent dark or shadowy areas, yet not so strong that it’s uncomfortable for the eyes.</p>
    <p>Pay particular attention to traditionally dark areas, such as the garage and closets. Make sure those areas are bright too.</p>
    <p>If you have a viewing scheduled during the day, take advantage of natural light through windows. Open the curtains!</p>
    <p>Finally, one of the most important areas is the foyer. Always make sure the entrance has sufficient lighting.</p>`,

    <p>Although the most common type of door is the traditional solid 6-panel door, there are many other choices available. Want to add light and a greater sense of space to a room? Consider a door with glass panels. Do you have an interior door that gets in the way when opened? Change it to a bi-fold door, which cuts the distance of the swing in half.</p>
    <p>There are also specialty doors that are designed to block noise, and sliding doors that tuck neatly into the wall when opened.</p>
    <p>Interior doors are typically much less expensive than their exterior counterparts. So, making the decision to upgrade or add a door to a room is an affordable design option.</p>

    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>1. Will a renovation truly fix what you don’t like about your property?</strong></p>
    <p>If you’re tired of a small kitchen, for example, given the layout of your house, it might not be possible to make it any bigger. On the other hand, if you’re craving a spacious rec room with a cozy fireplace, then a renovation could make that happen.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are some things you may want that aren’t specific to your house, such as an easier commute or nearby park. Those are features you may only be able to get by moving.</p>
    <p><strong>2. How much will a renovation cost? How does that compare to the cost of moving to a new home?<br /></strong><br />It’s important to get accurate estimates of both the cost to renovate, and the cost of a new home, so you can make an informed decision. </p>
    <p>Renovations often have a habit of costing more than you originally anticipate. Remember, the final result should be a home you want to stay in for quite some time.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Beware of compromising versus settling.<br /></strong><br />Whichever decision you make &#8211; to renovate or to sell &#8211; you can expect to have to make at least some compromises. That’s normal.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the impact of adding an extension to your house. It would be a major renovation. Is it the ideal way to get the extra room you want? Do the benefits of renovating outweigh the benefits of finding a new larger home that already includes the space you need?</p>`,

    content: `<p>Imagine if you dreamed of owning a special limited-edition vehicle. What would you do to ensure that your dream vehicle would someday be parked in your driveway &#8211; with your name on the ownership papers?</p>
    <p>You would probably start by doing some research. You’d find out how much that vehicle would cost, what features are available, and so forth. You would likely visit a local dealership and take a test drive if a model is available on site. You would keep an eye on the market for any that come up and let the dealer know you’re looking for just that car.</p>
    <p>If you did, then, someday, you’d probably be the proud owner of the limited-edition car of your dreams.</p>
    <p>What does this have to do with real estate?</p>
    <p>Well, you can take the same approach when there’s a community you’d love to live in someday. You can target it, learn what homes typically cost in that area, and keep your eye on that market in case a property becomes available that meets your criteria.</p>
    <p>By focusing on a specific community, you increase your chances of someday living there, simply because you’re focusing on it.</p>
    <p>Of course, community targeting isn’t as simple as aiming to own a specific car someday. That’s why you need a real estate professional who can keep an eye on that community on your behalf, and alert you to opportunities that become available.</p>
    <p>Then, if a listing that’s a good fit comes on the market, you can decide whether or not to make a move.</p>`,

    <p>George was funny. The problem is not. Here are some low-cost ideas for quickly creating storage space for your stuff.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Attach a cloth pouch or thin plastic basket to the inside of cupboard doors. This is a great way to store Tupperware lids, cosmetics, etc.</li>
    <li>Install hooks inside the foyer closet for loose items such as hats and scarfs.</li>
    <li>Use egg cartons to make effective storage inserts in drawers.</li>
    <li>Fashion stores often put purchases in stiff, high-quality boxes. Placed on their sides, these make effective storage compartments. (Shoeboxes are especially effective.)</li>
    <li>Consider using suitcases for out-of-season clothing. In addition to storage, they also provide protection.</li>

    <p>There are a couple of things to consider:</p>
    <p>First, think about the last time you purchased a car. You probably had a price range in mind and a general idea of the kind of vehicle you wanted. After visiting a few dealerships &#8211; or shopping online &#8211; you probably discovered seven or eight models that fit your criteria.</p>

    <p>Is it possible that you still won’t find a home that’s absolutely perfect for you in every way? Of course it is. However, there is an excellent chance you’ll get into a property that has everything you need and most, if not all, of what you want.</p>

    content: `<p>As technology evolves and becomes more affordable, homeowners should consider replacing their older equipment with a completely new security system, rather than patching together outdated units that provide specific functions in isolation.</p>
    <p>A modern system will wake you up in the morning to your own personalized display screen, adjust your room temperature, turn on your lights and operate other household functions. When you leave the house, wireless technology will allow you to watch your property, both inside and out, from any number of computing devices. This means you can also program household functions from afar.</p>
    <p>These newer residential security systems can coordinate a wide range of functions by remote control, from locking windows and closing the garage door, to adjusting the thermostat, drapery and lighting. They can even notify you if a room has been entered or a cabinet has been opened. Commercial-type closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV) with live video feed are also being introduced to residential systems in many average-sized homes. In addition, these modern systems coordinate driveway and doorway cameras (connected to your home computer or TV), monitor for break-ins, provide smoke and CO2 detection, and include water sensors for the detection of a burst pipe, leaking water tank or an overflowing tub.</p>
    <p>In the near future, residential video surveillance will distinguish pets from people, and even burglars from letter carriers. The latest CCTV cameras can identify intruders using motion or heat sensors or even activity pattern recognition (e.g. climbing a fence or jimmying a lock).</p>`,

    <p>This scenario often plays out in the real estate market as well.</p>
    <p>Buyers drive up to a home for sale and quickly form an impression based on what they see “from the curb”. That’s why you’ll hear real estate experts talk about the importance of “curb appeal”. It’s one of the most important selling points of a property.</p>
    <p>If you plan to put your home on the market, you want your home to look as attractive as possible from the street. Fortunately, there are many simple things you can do to improve curb appeal.</p>
    <p>For example, you can trim shrubs and hedges, plant flowers, clean the walkway and driveway, paint the front door and garage door, and clean the exteriors of the windows. All these projects are relatively easy and inexpensive. Yet, each can have a dramatic impact on a buyer’s first impression.</p>
    <p>Don’t be like the great restaurant that’s hidden behind an unkept façade. Make sure your curb appeal reflects the overall value of your property.</p>

    <p>First, clear the countertops. Put away the toaster and other items. You want to make the entire countertop area seem as spacious as possible.</p>
    <p>If the cabinetry is old, you can spruce it up by installing new knobs, handles and other hardware. A fresh coat of paint on the walls and ceiling can also make the kitchen look like it has had a major renovation &#8211; but will only cost a few hundred dollars. According to an article on the website HGTV.com. “The fastest, most inexpensive kitchen updates include painting and new cabinet hardware.”</p>
    <p>Replacing the countertops is a more expensive renovation, but may be worthwhile if the current counters are old and worn.</p>
    <p>Finally, when preparing your kitchen for a viewing, make sure it’s clean and tidy. The garbage and recycling bins should be empty. Buyers will open cabinets, so make sure items on shelves are neatly organized with the front labels facing forward.</p>`,

Perhaps you’re looking for a large deck surrounded by picturesque landscaping, a beautiful kitchen with gleaming marble countertops, or a cozy living room with a fireplace.</p>
    <p>You should be looking for the ideal home. You deserve it! But some home buyers become fixated on finding the “perfect” property, and pass too quickly on those homes that don’t quite measure up.</p>
    <p>That can be a mistake, because some of those less-than-perfect properties have the potential to become your next dream home.</p>
    <p>First, a home that is lacking some desirable features will probably cost less. Those savings may be more than enough to cover any needed upgrades or renovations.</p>
    <p>Secondly, if you look at a home in terms of its potential, rather than the features it happens to have now, there will be more properties available on the market for you to consider.</p>
    <p>If you’re determined to have a large wrap-around deck for entertaining, for example, don’t cross homes off your list that don’t have this feature. At least not yet. Instead, view these properties with an eye on potential. Is the backyard big enough to accommodate a large deck? How would that deck look if it were added to this particular property? How much would such a renovation cost?</p>
    <p>There’s no doubt about it. You want to find a home that has the features and characteristics you want. But, keep an open mind. Sometimes a “diamond in the rough” can &#8211; with an upgrade or renovation &#8211; become a home you’ll treasure for years.</p>`,

    <p>Of course, all of those things add warmth and meaning to your home.

Those pleasant mementos that mean so much to you may actually turn off potential buyers.</p>

    <p>So, to help sell your home quickly, make it look great, but not personalized. Think of the showroom displays you see set up in furniture stores. Those displays are most appealing when they enable you to easily picture yourself, with that furniture, in your home. You probably wouldn’t feel that way if it looked like the furniture belonged to someone else.</p>

    <p>There are many ways to soundproof areas of your home to reduce noise. Here are some ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Furniture placement. Surprisingly, where you place furniture can dramatically reduce incoming noise. For example, a bookshelf that covers one third of a wall can muffle sound from an adjoining room by 25%.</li>
        <li>Noise harmonization techniques. Soft music, air fans, and other sources of rhythmic noises can actually reduce the unpleasantness of incoming sounds.</li>
        <li>Area rugs. Adding an area rug, even on top of existing carpeting, can significantly reduce noise coming from the floor below.</li>
        <li>Acoustic tiles and panels. These are special ceiling tiles and wall coverings that are designed to diffuse and reduce sound infiltration. There are some products on the market that are remarkably easy to install.</li>
    </ul>`,

    content: `<p>If you’ve ever been on a cruise ship, you know that rough waters can result in a miserable experience. Even on modern ships equipped with stabilizers, choppy seas and bad weather can leave you stuck below deck - and possibly sea sick!<br />In fact, the expression “smooth sailing” comes from a desire for calm waters.</p>
    <p>When you sell your property, you’ll want smooth sailing too! You’ll want the experience to be as nondisruptive as possible, while also having plenty of qualified buyers interested in your listing. In the end, you’ll want the transaction to get done without a hitch.</p>
    <p>So how do you ensure that happens? Here are some things you can do to help:</p>
    <p>Think of your home as a product. Potential buyers are more likely to become interested in a product that looks clean, uncluttered and well-maintained.</p>
    <p>Price it right. If your property is listed too high, potential buyers won’t come. If it’s listed too low, you may leave money on the table. (Potentially thousands.) Setting the price will be one of the most important decisions you’ll need to make when selling your home.</p>
    <p>Don’t be there during showings. As your real estate agent, I will take buyers through your property and show them all the great features. If you’re there, some buyers may not feel comfortable and may leave before they have had a chance to become interested.</p>
    <p>Be flexible. This is especially important, when it comes to showing appointments, negotiations, home inspections, closing dates, etc. It’s okay to be firm on some things, just not everything!</p>
    <p>The best tip of all? Use me as your real estate agent and I will make the entire experience of selling your home trouble-free and successful.</p>
    <p>In other words, let me help make it smooth sailing!</p>`,

    content: ` <p>Let’s face it. Life can get complicated, complex and stressful very easily. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to simplify your life, especially at home. Here are some tips from the experts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Don’t be ruled by the TV guide. Instead, select the shows you want to watch and record them. That way, you can watch what you want at the times that are most convenient for you.</li>
        <li>Prepare some meals in advance and freeze them. Simply heat them up as needed. That will reduce a lot of after-work, “gotta-get-dinner-ready” stress.</li>
        <li>Create a weekly dinner menu. It takes some time to prepare, but it allows you to shop effectively, and greatly reduces the stress of figuring out what to cook each day.</li>
        <li>Don’t accumulate stuff you don’t want or need. Give those things away.</li>
        <li>Simplify your cleaning by dividing tasks into 10 minute chunks (such as vacuuming the living room.) Then, fit those tasks in whenever you have 10 minutes to spare.</li>
        <li>To avoid clutter, adopt the “touch it once” rule, which simply means you put things where they belong right away.</li>
        <li>Limit the time you and others in your family spend checking emails and text messages. Consider having an hour or two of “no screen” time each evening.</li>
        <li>Develop healthy routines, such as evening walks and family board game night.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few ideas. If you want to simplify your home life, you can probably brainstorm several other strategies and habits you can try. The idea is to make your home an enjoyable place to be &#8211; for you and your family.</p>`,

    New synthetic fabric dumpsters offer a flexible method of holding and disposing of renovation waste &#8211; without the need to order a large and unsightly metal bin that sits on your front lawn or driveway for weeks on end.
    <br/>
    The industry calls them FIBC’s, or Flexible Intermediate Bulk Containers, but they’re more commonly known as big bags, bulk bags, bagsters and super sacks.
</p>
<p>These durable trash containers can be purchased and taken home (or delivered) for indefinite use, then picked up for a preset fee when full.</p>
<p>When the bag is picked up, another bag is dropped off. Available through specialty suppliers or through some home renovation stores, these “soft bins” are easy to move when empty, and they take up much less space than large metal dumpsters. They also take much less time to fill up, so you’ll have a tidier renovation site and less of an eyesore on your property.</p>`,

    paragraph1: "Whether you’re considering buying a particular home, selling your current property – or doing both – a home inspection can help.",
    content: `<p>Whether you’re considering buying a particular home, selling your current property &#8211; or doing both &#8211; a home inspection can help.</p>
    <p>This inspection is conducted by a qualified professional who takes a close look at every aspect of a home &#8211; structure, wiring, plumbing, and more &#8211; and identifies issues you may not have noticed yourself.</p>
    <p>For example, a home inspector can determine that a furnace will need to be replaced soon, or that there is a water leak that needs to be fixed.</p>
    <p>You’ll definitely want to get a professional home inspection before you buy a particular property. That’s why most offers to purchase a home are conditional upon passing a home inspection. (The last thing you want is to buy your dream home only to discover that the wiring needs to be updated!)</p>
    <p>You may also want to get a home inspection on your own home before you list it for sale. A certificate from a qualified professional that states that your home passed inspection will make your property more attractive to buyers.</p>
    <p>Many reputable home inspectors are members of a professional industry association. However, it’s important to note that certification or licensing is not a requirement in many jurisdictions. So, select a home inspector carefully.</p>`,

    paragraph1: "When you show your home to prospective buyers, there is probably a long list of things you’re hoping they’ll notice. But what about those things you’re hoping buyers will not notice?",
    content: `<p>When you show your home to prospective buyers, there is probably a long list of things you’re hoping they’ll notice. For example, you’ll want them to see the beautiful chandelier in the foyer or the spacious backyard and large deck, or the kitchen with the island big enough for a whole family to sit down for breakfast.<br />But what about those things you’re hoping buyers will not notice?</p>
    <p>Every home has some features that are less than enticing to the typical buyer. You may not be able to do much about a small kitchen or a home backing onto a noisy main street.</p>
    <p>However, there are several things buyers don’t want to see that you can change. Here are five of the most common:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Clutter.</strong> Closets stuffed full of clothes or rooms crammed with too much furniture are distractions. Clutter of any kind makes buyers feel uneasy &#8211; and gets in the way of showcasing the wonderful features of your home.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance issues.</strong> Buyers definitely don’t want to see a lot of things that need repairs or replacement, such as dripping faucets, faded or chipped walls, or overgrown lawns and shrubbery.</li>
    <li><strong>Smells.</strong> Of course, you can’t see smells. But buyers will notice the lingering aroma of exotic cooking, cigarette smoke, and pets. These smells may even limit the amount of time they want to spend exploring the home.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal items.</strong> Buyers will understand that a family is living in the home they’re viewing. However, constant reminders &#8211; in the form of vacation pictures, trophies, or scattered children’s toys &#8211; can make a buyer feel like an intruder.</li>
    <li><strong>You.</strong> It’s nothing personal, but buyers prefer to view your home without you in it.<br />Fortunately, all these things can be easily dealt with before you show your home.</li>

    paragraph1: "There’s no doubt about it. If you want to keep your home safe from break-ins, you should have good locks on all doors and windows and ideally have an alarm system in place.",
    content: `<p>There’s no doubt about it. If you want to keep your home safe from break-ins, you should have good locks on all doors and windows and ideally have an alarm system in place.</p>
    <p>But home security doesn’t end with locks and alarms. There are other less obvious ways to keep your home safe. For example:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Install exterior lights with a motion detection feature. A light suddenly going on will almost always send a potential intruder away.</li>
    <li>Look for &#8211; and, if possible, eliminate &#8211; potential hiding spots around your property.</li>
    <li>Always leave some lights on in your home when you’re away for an evening.</li>
    <li>Never announce that you’re on vacation or otherwise away from your home on social media sites. (Ask your kids not to do this either!)</li>
    <li>Don’t leave tempting valuables where they can be easily seen through a window.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to good locking systems on doors and windows, simple precautions like these will significantly lower the risk of a break-in.</p>`,

    date: "November 6, 2023",
    paragraph1: "It’s not uncommon for couples with growing families to trade in their compact cars for something roomier, like a mini-van. The same thing happens with homes. Sometimes families simply outgrow them.",
    content: `<p>It’s not uncommon for couples with growing families to trade in their compact cars for something roomier, like a mini-van. The same thing happens with homes. Sometimes families simply outgrow them.</p>
    <p>How can you tell if that’s happening with your property? Here are some sure-fire signs:</p>
    <p><strong>1 &#8211; You need more space.<br /></strong>This is the most common reason people upgrade to a new home. They need more room. For any number of reasons, you might want an extra bedroom, a larger living room, a bigger backyard, or a more spacious kitchen. Rather than put up with feeling cramped, consider exploring the extra space a new home can provide.</p>
    <p><strong>2 &#8211; A renovation won’t fix it.</strong><br />Sometimes, when a property doesn’t fit its owners’ needs anymore, they consider a renovation. For example, if they need more space for a home office, they convert a spare room. However, a renovation doesn’t always fix the problem. For example, building a double, rather than single driveway and garage, may not be possible given the constraints of your property. Only a new home can solve that problem.</p>
    <p><strong>3 &#8211; You’re interested in a new area.<br /></strong>The community may have been perfect for you at one time. But needs evolve. You may now be looking for something the area doesn’t provide &#8211; like closer access to a recreational activity your family enjoys, or a more convenient commute to work. If that’s the case, it might be time to look at other communities you’d like to consider, and see what types of homes are currently available there.</p>
    <p><strong>4 &#8211; It’s time for a change.<br /></strong>Sometimes you simply feel it’s time for a change. There’s nothing wrong with that. Don’t feel you need a practical reason to sell and find a new home. If this feels like the right time for you and your family to move, go for it.</p>`,
