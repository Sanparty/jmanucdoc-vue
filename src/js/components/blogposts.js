    `<p>Kitchen renovations tend to be the biggest, most complicated home makeover projects, mainly because the kitchen is the most frequented and most multifunctional room in modern homes. But sometimes a kitchen makeover can be achieved with some simple cosmetic changes, rather than a complete redesign of the actual floor plan.</p>
    <p>   
    Beyond a basic color scheme change, the next makeover level involves replacing cabinet hardware. Remove a set of hinges, knobs and/or pulls to identify the type of screw/bolt settings that will be needed. Then, choose from the many options available at home building centers or specialty knob stores. Similarly, consider a new faucet and sink, upgraded countertop or a fresh tile backsplash. Each will contribute to a dramatic change. You may want to consider replacing or refinishing the drawer and cupboard facings as well, although that would likely require professional help.
    </p>
    <p>
    Improved lighting is another important way to change a kitchen’s look and functionality. However, general overhead lighting, strategic task lighting and ambient mood lighting could involve rewiring. Finally, replacing the flooring will result in a significant change to any kitchen. Choices range from recycled cork to indestructible granite. Remember to consider not only appearance but also practicality.

    `<p>Property Surveyors, sometimes referred to as Land Surveyors, play a vital role in the real estate world. They are the professionals who determine or confirm the exact boundaries of a property.</p>
    <p>Will you need to deal with a Property Surveyor when you sell your home?</p>
    <p>You might.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the mortgage lender will ask for a land survey, especially if your property is older and hasn’t changed hands in many years. You might also be asked for one by the buyer if there is any confusion about the size and boundaries of your property – or if significant changes have been made to it in recent years.</p>
    <p>This is nothing to be concerned about.</p>
    <p>A qualified Property Surveyor will do the appropriate inspections and measurements on your property and issue you the survey.</p>
    <p>Property Surveyors are highly trained and licensed. The profession is represented by their respective governing bodies.</p>
    <p>Before spending the money on a new land survey, make sure you don’t already have one. Hopefully, you’ve stored the paperwork that relates to the purchase of your home. Look through it. A valid land survey might be right there.</p>

    `<p>Sometimes we don’t get to choose whether or not to sell our home and buy another one. Circumstances, such as a job relocation, may make that decision for us.</p>
    <p>However, most often, the decision to move is discretionary. Sometimes people move simply because they think it’s a good idea. They feel that “now” is the right time to find their next dream home.</p>
    <p>You may feel you need to find a new home, because you’ve outgrown your current property. Perhaps you have a growing family and require more space. Maybe you’re doing more entertaining and need a larger backyard with a more spacious deck. It could be that the commute to work is arduous and you need to move to a place that’s closer.</p>
    <p>Those “needs” may motivate you to move, but sometimes a “want” can play an important role too.</p>
    <p>For example, you may want to live in a quieter area or in a newly built home that requires less maintenance. Maybe you simply want a change.</p>
    <p>If you’re thinking of making a move, take a moment to write down a list of your needs and wants. Seeing them on paper will help make the decision easier.</p>

    `<p>When you see a new home you like on the market, it’s easy to get distracted by all the features you love - the wrap-around backyard deck or the spacious recreation room that has plenty of space for entertaining. You just need to make sure that in all your excitement you don’t overlook any expensive maintenance issues that could be just around the corner.</p>
    <p>Nothing lasts forever. The major components of every home - from the furnace to the roof shingles - need to be replaced eventually. But, knowing when those maintenance issues are likely to arise can help you make a smarter decision about the home you’re considering.</p>
    <p>How do you do that?</p>
    <p>When viewing the property, ask for the age of the major components of the home, such as the roof shingles, furnace, air conditioner, water heater, and appliances. You might think the roof shingles look merely weathered in spots and have years of service left – when in fact, they’re due to be replaced next year.</p>
    <p>Also pay close attention to the backyard deck, fencing, flooring, and windows. Do any of those components look aged, worn, and in need of repair or replacement sometime soon?</p>
    <p>Finally, don’t forget to check the kitchen and bathrooms. Sinks, faucets, bathtubs, showers, and cabinetry have a life-span of about 10-15 years.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are things you can’t see on your own, such as wiring, plumbing, venting, and other components of a property that may require maintenance. That’s why you should always make any offer to purchase a home conditional on passing an inspection by a qualified home inspector.</p>

    `<p>It has become standard for retailers to offer low cost supplementary “insurance protection plans” on appliances and electronics. These plans may seem like a good idea, but before you buy one, be sure the plan actually offers real added value. Often, these plans overlap with other protection programs you already have.</p>
    <p>For example, reputable retailers usually sell products with solid manufacturer warranties, because they don’t want the bad reputation or the hassles that come from unhappy customers. In fact, in today’s competitive world, many retailers already have a “satisfaction guaranteed” policy built into everything they sell. In addition, if you are paying by credit card, you may have purchaser protection that is activated by simply using the card.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are many consumer protection plans that do offer reasonable value. For example, some extended warranties offer a safety net after the manufacturer’s warranty runs out (similar to extended warranty automobile plans). In those cases, be sure the product is one you’ll want to keep and use for the duration of the warranty period. For example, it makes no sense to pay an extra thirty dollars on a one hundred dollar item, if you expect you will be able to buy a newer version in a few years for even less. Some “total care” service plans for complicated equipment, such as a car, computer or HVAC unit, are quite popular, as are “price freezing” plans on home utilities, such as electricity, gas and water. At the end of the day, it all comes down to your confidence in a product or service, and your willingness to put up with (or pay to avoid) the inconvenience of complaining, should it fail to meet your expectations.</p>`,

    `<p>The following tips will help you avoid waste when watering your lawn:</p>
    <div>
    <ul>
    <li>Use a low-angle, pulsating sprinkler. Water sprayed high into the air produces a mist that loses much of its moisture through evaporation.</li>
    <li>Water the lawn, not the sidewalk or driveway.</li>
    <li>Lawns need about an inch of water per week. To determine how much watering time that requires, place an empty tuna tin within your sprinkler’s range, and note how long it takes to fill.</li>
    <li>When watering, account for recent rain.</li>
    <li>Use an automatic sprinkler system that allows you to adjust the area, frequency and/or duration. Set the timer to operate just prior to sunrise.</li>
    <li>Attach rain barrels to downspouts, in order to catch and hold roof runoff and then re-distribute it to your lawn, garden or container plants. Keep it covered for safety reasons, and to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. (Note: rainwater is actually better for plants because it doesn’t contain chlorine and has an ambient temperature).</li>

    `<p>If you take care to price your home correctly - that is, at a price that is in line with what similar properties in the area have sold for recently - then you have a good chance of selling it at or near your asking price.</p>
    <p>That doesn’t mean you won’t get a low-ball offer. You might. So, what do you do when that happens?</p>
    <p>First, understand that the buyer may not necessarily be trying to steal away your home at a bargain-basement price. They might simply be mistaken about its true market value. Of course, they might also be coming in at a low price in the hopes they’ll get lucky.</p>
    <p>You will never actually know the buyer’s motives. So, it would be a mistake to get angry or dismiss the offer out-of-hand. That low-ball offer might end up being the beginning of a negotiation that results in the sale of your home at a good price.</p>
    <p>Your first step is to work with a Real Estate Professional to determine:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Whether the buyer is serious.</li>
    <li>Whether the buyer is qualified. (For example, do they have a pre-approved mortgage?)</li>
    <li>How amenable the buyer is to a counter-offer that reflects the true market value of your home.</li>
    <li>What that counter-offer should be.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This isn’t an easy process. It takes the knowledge and experience of a professional real estate agent to get it right.</p>`,

    `<p>One of the most prominent features of any home is the windows. If they are well maintained, they will have a positive impact on the impression potential buyers have of your property. Of course, the opposite occurs when your windows look old and worn.</p>
    <p>So, does that mean you should replace your windows?</p>
    <p>That depends on a number of factors. Window replacement can be an expensive renovation. Here are a few things to consider before making your decision.</p>
    <ul type="1">
    <li>Do you see water infiltration or mildew on the interior sides of any of the window sills? This means that moisture is creeping in from the outside, and you need to get those windows repaired or replaced as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>If your windows are double-paned - (two panes of glass) - check for any signs of moisture in between the glass panes. Moisture indicates that the thermal seal is broken and, at a minimum, the glass will need to be replaced.</li>
    <li>Take a look at your windows from the outside. Is the trim rotted or cracked anywhere? Are there dark spots or any signs of rotting on the wood frames? Repairs or replacement may be required.</li>
    <li>Check the operation of your windows. Do they open and close easily? Some windows, such as those in bedrooms, are often designed to be big enough to use as an exit in case of a fire. It’s important to make sure those work properly.</li>
    <li>Finally, are you happy with how your windows look? Do you feel that your property will look significantly better with new windows?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although they are expensive, replacing windows can have a lot of advantages. Depending on the efficiency of your current windows, replacing them could cut your energy costs by 10-20%. In addition, new windows block out more exterior noise, making your home quieter.</p>`,

    `<p>If you want to improve how your home shows to potential buyers, you don’t necessarily need to invest in a costly remodeling or renovation. In fact, there are some simple - and relatively inexpensive - things you can do to make your property look significantly better.</p>
    <p>Let’s take a look at some of the options available:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Paint it.</strong></p>
    <p>There’s no doubt about it. A fresh coat of paint will significantly improve the appearance of just about any area of your home. In fact, compared to other home improvements, painting will give you the highest return on investment when you sell your property. Think beyond walls. Painting a door, window frame, garage floor or deck can make those features look like new.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Declutter it.</strong></p>
    <p>Eliminating clutter will make your home look more attractive, roomy and comfortable to buyers. Do an inventory of each room. Ask yourself: “What can I throw out? Give away? Sell? Put into storage?”</p>
    <p><strong>3. Put up mirrors.</strong></p>
    <p>Mirrors are a relatively inexpensive design feature. Yet, according to an article in Style At Home magazine, they can make small rooms appear bigger and dark rooms seem brighter. You don’t necessarily need to buy wall-hanging mirrors. Standalone floor models will have the same effect.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Repair it.</strong></p>
    <p>In most cases, you will have to get any needed repairs done anyway. So, do them before you show your home. That way buyers will focus on the appealing features of your property, not the minor defects.</p>`,

Health and/or mobility concerns may require them to either retrofit their existing home to meet their changing needs, or to seek a more accommodating home.</p>
    <p>The decision can be difficult because many simply don’t want to move. In such cases, especially if mobility challenges are arising, wheelchair accessibility may be necessary, not just at the home’s entrance, but under counters, in bathrooms, and through doorways as well. Ramps, elevators and stair-lifts may also need to be considered.</p>
    <p>In addition, other small changes may need to be contemplated, such as easy-to-find and easy-to-use switches, possibly with remote or hands-free applications, as well as levers for all door handles. The addition of keyless entrances, remote control security and 24/7 monitoring devices will help put many family members at ease. However, in cases where a retrofit is cost-prohibitive, the logical option may well be to seek a bungalow or well-appointed condo that can be more easily adapted.</p>`,

    `<p>When you make an offer on a home, it’s a smart idea to have a professional home inspector check it out from top to bottom. This inspection will ensure that the property doesn’t have any unexpected “issues”. After all, you don’t want to buy a home only to discover that the roof needs to be replaced, immediately, for thousands of dollars.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, you might question whether you really need to invest the few hundred dollars it costs for a professional home inspection. “The home we want to buy looks like it’s in very good shape,” you might be thinking. “I can’t see anything wrong with it.”</p>
    <p>However, a professional home inspector can see things you can’t. When you view a property that’s on the market, you might be able to notice obvious issues, like a crack in the foundation or a dripping faucet. If you’re experienced with home maintenance, you might even notice roofing tiles that look like they’re overdue for replacement.</p>
    <p>But, most people don’t have the equipment, knowledge or experience to identify all the issues a home inspector can.</p>
    <p>A home inspector will, for example, use a special device to check for moisture build-up in the washrooms – which can be an indication of mold. A home inspector will also inspect wiring to make sure everything is safe and compliant with the building code.</p>
    <p>That’s not all.</p>
    <p>Like a determined detective, a home inspector will investigate the property’s structure, electrical and plumbing systems, insulation, and other components – and then report the findings to you. In the end, a professional home inspection gives you peace-of-mind and protects your investment. So, getting one is highly recommended – even for recently built homes.</p>`,

    `<p>Sometimes you know a desirable street when you see one. For example, it’s obvious that a home on a cul-de-sac is enticing mainly because there isn’t any through traffic.</p>
    <p>What are the other characteristics of a desirable street that may not be as obvious? Here are just a few:</p>
    <p><strong>Sidewalks</strong>. A sidewalk in front of your home is not only handy, it also adds to the property’s curb appeal. In addition, if you have kids, a sidewalk makes it easier - and safer - for them to play and visit neighborhood friends.</p>
    <p><strong>Mature trees</strong>. Trees lining the street add depth and beauty. Most homeowners value front yard trees and would miss them if they were gone.</p>
    <p><strong>Safety</strong>. Unfortunately, some streets are more prone to crime and other issues requiring police intervention than others. Clearly, homeowners appreciate a street that’s known for being safe and located in a community with a low crime rate.</p>
    <p><strong>Pride-of-ownership</strong>. When considering buying a home, take a walk along the street. Do homeowners take good care of their properties? If so, that sign of pride-of-ownership indicates it’s a great place to own a home.</p>
    <p><strong>Location</strong>. Where the street is located is just as important as its characteristics. Are things you want, such as parks, schools, shopping, etc. nearby? Is the street in a desirable area overall?</p>
    <p><strong>Noise</strong>. This is a characteristic that can be invisible to the home buyer. If the street is in a flight path, or near a busy highway used by rush-hour commuters, you want to know!</p>
    <p>A great street can dramatically add to the enjoyment of a home.</p>`,

    "December 5, 2022",
    "When it comes to home fire safety, a little preparation and precaution go a long way toward ensuring your family, your home, and your valuables are protected.  Consider the following important information about preventing, fighting and escaping residential fires.",
    `<p>When it comes to home fire safety, a little preparation and precaution go a long way toward ensuring your family, your home, and your valuables are protected.&nbsp; Consider the following important information about preventing, fighting and escaping residential fires.</p>
    <p><strong>Fires and Fire Extinguishers</strong></p>
    <p>Fires are classified into different types, depending on the material burning. Fire extinguishers are similarly classified according to the type of burning materials they are designed to extinguish: A type for paper, wood and natural fabric; B type for grease, oil and combustible fuels; and C type for electrical fires. Since residential fires can involve any type of material, every home should have at least one multi-purpose ABC fire extinguisher that is easy to use. In addition, if you store chemicals, you should have an extinguisher designed for that specific chemical in order to ensure that no adverse reaction is caused by the mixture of the burning chemical with the fire extinguisher solution. For example, a poisonous gas is produced when chlorine comes in contact with ammonia, yet ammonia is found in most Class A extinguishers. Remember that your fire extinguishers should be positioned near (but not too close to) cooking areas, fireplaces and other likely sources of fire, and should be inspected and/or replaced according to safety guidelines.</p>
    <p><strong>Smoke Detectors</strong></p>
    <p>There should be at least one smoke detector on every floor of your home, as well as outside each bedroom in larger homes. If any resident is hearing-impaired, consider strobe-light alarms. To avoid false alarms, only use smoke detectors designed for specific areas. For example, ionization types are best for bedroom areas, and less sensitive photo-electric detectors are better for the kitchen. Some building and safety codes require hard-wired detectors that are permanently connected to AC power, with back-up battery power. Keep all smoke detectors dust-free, and don’t paint them. Remember to test and replace the batteries regularly, and note the units’ expiry dates.</p>
    <p><strong>Security Precautions, Prevention and Protection</strong></p>
    <p>It is wise to do whatever you can to protect your family and valuables by preventing fires, rather than only reacting to them. For instance, experts urge all homeowners to discourage smoking indoors, especially in bedrooms, and to be wary of purchasing flammable fabrics and furnishings, or unsafe, unapproved building materials. It’s also recommended that you ensure that your priceless valuables and critical financial records are kept in a fire-proof safe, preferably away from home, or that you keep copies of critical documents elsewhere. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>`,

You might have seen an attractive lamp on a sofa end table, or an appetizing bowl of fruit on a dining room buffet.</p>
    <p>When preparing your home for sale, you should do much the same thing. Stage each room to make it look its best. Studies prove this will help sell your home faster and for a better price.</p>
    <p>Here are some simple, affordable staging tips:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Make each room look as spacious as possible. This may mean putting some items, and even some furniture, into storage.  </li>
    <li>Remove unnecessary items from countertops, tables and shelves.</li>
    <li>Keep decorative objects on shelves, tables and even sofas, in odd number groupings. According to Barb Schwartz, the originator of staging, this combination works best. So, put three pillows on a sofa, not two or four.</li>
    <li>Make an older-looking piece of furniture look quaint and stylish by adding a throw cover.</li>
    <li>Add life and good looks to just about any living space by adding flowers or a flowering plant.</li>
    <li>Have the table set with your best china. It makes the buyer want to move in and sit down for dinner!</li>
    <li>Consider replacing the sink, faucets and toilet to make an older bathroom look much better. It’s relatively quick and inexpensive.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Professional stagers look at your home through the eyes of the buyer. Do the same and you’ll be able to see what changes need to be made.</p>`,

    `<p>Shopping for a new home can be intimidating. With so many things to do and think about, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Here are some good tips for making the home hunting process a lot easier and much less stressful.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Get your mortgage arranged in advance.</strong> </p>
    <p>You don’t want to find the ideal home on the market, only to face problems arranging a suitable mortgage. You might end up losing the opportunity. So, make mortgage arrangements in advance by getting “pre-approved”. With that pre-approval, you can shop for a new home with confidence.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Clearly define the kind of home you want, and the area you want to live in.</strong> </p>
    <p>You can’t view every home that’s on the market. If you try, you’ll burn yourself out! So, write down a clear description of the kind of home you want. How many bedrooms? Big kitchen? Pool? Don’t forget to include the community. Upscale? Close to downtown? Lots of trees and parks? Urban and close to shopping and entertainment? With this information, a shortlist of properties can be created that meet your criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Take good notes.</strong> </p>
    <p>After viewing a few homes, you may easily start to forget the details. Was it the first property that had the large elm tree in the backyard or was that the fourth property you saw? If you take good notes, you’ll be better able to make decisions later on about which homes to shortlist.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Take care of yourself, and your family.</strong> </p>
    <p>Eat right. Pace yourself. Don’t try to view too many homes in one evening or on one Saturday afternoon.</p>`,

    `<p>Remember the last time you visited an upscale furniture showroom? The furniture and fixtures on display probably looked great. The colors and textures jumped out at you. It was a feast for the eyes!</p>
    <p>There is a good reason why: <strong><em>Lighting</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>Of course, the quality of the products has a lot to do with how appealing they look when on display. But smart retailers know that proper lighting is key to making those products look their best. In fact, some retailers even hire lighting consultants!</p>
    <p>What does this have to do with selling your home quickly, and for the best price?</p>
    <p>Obviously, when showing your property to potential buyers, you want your home to look its very best. Proper lighting can be a big help.</p>
    <p>When preparing your home for sale, review the lighting in each room and make sure the space is sufficiently well lit. You want the lighting to be strong enough to prevent dark or shadowy areas, yet not so strong that it’s uncomfortable for the eyes.</p>
    <p>Pay particular attention to traditionally dark areas, such as the garage and closets. Make sure those areas are bright too.</p>
    <p>If you have a viewing scheduled during the day, take advantage of natural light through windows. Open the curtains!</p>
    <p>Finally, one of the most important areas is the foyer. Always make sure the entrance has sufficient lighting.</p>`,

    `<p>When people renovate or remodel a room, they almost always overlook the door. However, changing the style of an interior door, or adding a new one, can dramatically change the look of a living space &#8211; often for the better.</p>
    <p>Although the most common type of door is the traditional solid 6-panel door, there are many other choices available. Want to add light and a greater sense of space to a room? Consider a door with glass panels. Do you have an interior door that gets in the way when opened? Change it to a bi-fold door, which cuts the distance of the swing in half.</p>
    <p>There are also specialty doors that are designed to block noise, and sliding doors that tuck neatly into the wall when opened.</p>
    <p>Interior doors are typically much less expensive than their exterior counterparts. So, making the decision to upgrade or add a door to a room is an affordable design option.</p>
    <p>Visit a door showroom and explore the possibilities.</p>`,

    <tr>
    <td class="p-2">So, if you’re wondering whether to move or improve, here are three things to consider:</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>1. Will a renovation truly fix what you don’t like about your property?</strong></p>
    <p>If you’re tired of a small kitchen, for example, given the layout of your house, it might not be possible to make it any bigger. On the other hand, if you’re craving a spacious rec room with a cozy fireplace, then a renovation could make that happen.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are some things you may want that aren’t specific to your house, such as an easier commute or nearby park. Those are features you may only be able to get by moving.</p>
    <p><strong>2. How much will a renovation cost? How does that compare to the cost of moving to a new home?<br /></strong><br />It’s important to get accurate estimates of both the cost to renovate, and the cost of a new home, so you can make an informed decision. </p>
    <p>Renovations often have a habit of costing more than you originally anticipate. Remember, the final result should be a home you want to stay in for quite some time.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Beware of compromising versus settling.<br /></strong><br />Whichever decision you make &#8211; to renovate or to sell &#8211; you can expect to have to make at least some compromises. That’s normal.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the impact of adding an extension to your house. It would be a major renovation. Is it the ideal way to get the extra room you want? Do the benefits of renovating outweigh the benefits of finding a new larger home that already includes the space you need?</p>`,
